I was looking for a reasonably priced place to get a pedicure since the weather is getting warmer. This place had good reviews and was conveniently located, so I decided to give it a shot.

My roommate and I decided to get pedicures on our vacation.  We tried to look up some locations and prices. We couldn't find many places that listed prices but ran across great reviews for the Qua Spa at Cesaer's on yelp and decided to make an appointment. It turns out that Qua is the spa and Color is the salon. We were a little disappointed because we wanted to see what Qua was like.\n\nWe were lead in and given mimosas. The place is very bright white and has a lot of marble. Allyn did my pedicure and was really nice and easy to talk to. The chairs have a great rolling massage option which was better than the typical vibrating chair massage. They also played fun top 40's which my roommate and I bopped along too as we joked around with our pedicurists. Allyn did slough off slightly too much skin because my toe had a tiny trickle of blood ( it's not her fault though, my feet are bone dry and prone to cracking, it also didn't hurt at all). Overall, it was a great experience. The only downside was the price- $100 for just a pedicure, but we figured we were on vacation in Vegas and just shrugged it off!

0,"If you read my reviews in the past, I'm always writing a very positive and honest review.  Please don't be fooled when you walk in their store.  You will never have anyone come up to you to greet and to help you!  It's because, yes, they have what appears to be cool fish, but if you inquire, they'll sell you an illegal fish, too!  If I was able to give a zero star rating, I feel that would be a too generous of a rating for Trop-aquarium.  So let me expand on the facts I've experienced with this company.  First off Trop-Aquarium is the company that installed my 500 gallon fresh water tank which is built in a double sided wall.  The reason why we chose them was because they were less expensive than all the other quotes we received.  But in this case you really get what you pay for and less.  The reason for obtaining such a large fresh water tank was because I love large fish like big parrot fish and mainly an Arrowana.  We had 35 very large fish in the tank that we paid handsomely to Trop- Aquarium.  One Friday at noon 6 of our large fish died so because Trop- Aquarium maintained our tank, I texted, called and left a message immediately!  No response for a whole 3 days.  By now I'm frantically calling them because all 30 of my expensive fish had died.  Finally they pick up the phone and asked if I had over fed the fish, giggling and that they'll come in a day or two.  However meanwhile I, an unexperienced aquarium maintainer, was told that I need to remove all 30 dead corpses and to buy an airline with air rocks, 2 large buckets, tube everything properly, catch the remainder live fish, place them in the properly tubed buckets all at 12:36 am midnight.  They also offered if I don't know how to just leave the tank with only the dead fish removed, but I was sure all the live fish would've died by the time they came.  When they finally came days after, they realized that they had not glued down the returns.  So all the fish brutally suffocated before dieing.  The Trop-Aquarium technician cleaned the tank, drilled random visible holes in the Clear Vision tank to stick the airline pipe attached to the air rock that I had both purchased.  They verbally admitted to the installation error!  They then replaced our dead fish with 5 fish which were the size of a silver dollar.  Soon after their billing called us and said we owed them over $1000 for the work they did to fix the installation problem they created!  I contacted other aquarium builders and when they saw the tank, all six companies stated and agreed that no one ever would build a tank with no overflow mini tank and returns at the bottom.  Trop-Aquarium did this so that they would be the exclusive company to convert the tank, maintain it and also this way, they'd make a larger profit!  So, in conclusion, if you have limitless amount of money to burn,  want the cheapest specimen of fish in your fish tank, never want to get a timely response, and over all get scammed in the long run, Trop-Aquarium would be perfect for you!!!  Time is the true revealer of how a people are and how companies truly operate.  During my rough 5 year relationship with Trop- Aquarium, I come to realization that making $$$MONEY$$$ is their only priority and having a honest customer oriented business is NOT!!!!!  I WOULD NEVER WISH THIS EXPERIENCE UPON ANYONE ELSE!  You may have to pay a little more initially with another company, but in the long run over all, you will exceed a great amount of money you ever envisioned with Trop-Aquarium.","Trop-Aquarium has a wonderful selection of fish and they are very reasonably priced BUT good luck getting an employee in this store to even acknowledge you exist much less help you purchase some fish.

I contacted other aquarium builders and when they saw the tank, all six companies stated and agreed that no one ever would build a tank with no overflow mini tank and returns at the bottom.  Trop-Aquarium did this so that they would be the exclusive company to convert the tank, maintain it and also this way, they'd make a larger profit!  So, in conclusion, if you have limitless amount of money to burn,  want the cheapest specimen of fish in your fish tank, never want to get a timely response, and over all get scammed in the long run, Trop-Aquarium would be perfect for you!!!  Time is the true revealer of how a people are and how companies truly operate.  During my rough 5 year relationship with Trop- Aquarium, I come to realization that making $$$MONEY$$$ is their only priority and having a honest customer oriented business is NOT!!!!!  I WOULD NEVER WISH THIS EXPERIENCE UPON ANYONE ELSE!  You may have to pay a little more initially with another company, but in the long run over all, you will exceed a great amount of money you ever envisioned with Trop-Aquarium.

Ordered a grilled chicken sandwich tossed in their buzzed wing type sauce. ($9.99)  Entrees came in a timely manner.  Fries are good steak fries with seasoned salt on the table and a number of dipping sauces available.  I got my fries with the mayo/mustard sauce called campfire.  I should say I ordered my fries with it because when the fries arrived the sauce did not come with it.  By the time the sauce arrived the fries and wich were long gone.  I did use them on my second order of fries which came a good 10-15 minutes later.  Iced tea came pretty regularly.

I've been going back and forth as to how many stars this place should get.  I finally decided on 2 because I can't award 1/2 a star and feel 3 stars is too many.\n\nMy friends and I visited on a Saturday afternoon.  We entered and asked if we could sit in the bar area but we wouldn't be able to sit at the bar because there were too many of us.  The hostess was very short and said she would get something for us and be right back, then, she disappeared.  When she came back she led us to the furthest table from the bar.  Not what we wanted or asked for.  We decided we were going to ask for a table at the bar and was informed that outside was open seating- this would've helped when we asked the first time but, whatever.\n\nOur server was not the sunniest bulb in the box, meaning, she was not friendly.  Gosh, I hate that and it put me in a bad mood.  Last time I checked, she was there to help us at her own will, not against it.  Geesh.  We all had a couple drinks and some of us had appetizers.  They were good but nothing to write home about.  Bar food.\n\nMy favorite part of the evening was when my friends rode the bull.

THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! \n\nI walked in here in a tank and shorts with my cousin and I was looking at necklaces and bracelets and the lady working at that time (I wish i got her name) made me feel SO unwanted.

Worst customer service, I walk in and no one greeted me I sat myself as the sign said. Waited for almost 10 minutes and no one approached the table while 2 employees are sitting at the bar and watching tv. Then I sit at the bar and felt completely invisible. I walked out and nothing was said to me.

Worst customer service ever back in mid-January.  I'm a pretty chill, easy-going dude, but by the end of this visit I wanted to put every McD worker in a Ric Flair figure-four leglock. \n\nCashier was terrible.  Middle-aged dude looked like he was hating life (no comment here) and didn't greet patrons with anything more than a lazy nod.  He had to have been thinking, \""What the hell do you want?\""  A simple \""Hey, what can I get for you?\"" would have sufficed.\n\nI'm an optimist, but my orange juice was half-empty.  I hemmed and hawed about pointing it out, but did so.  Chick on duty returned with my juice filled with ice.  Really?  You don't think I can tell that its ice and not juice?  Later, chick said that the orange juice was not ready yet.  Might I suggest a solution?  GET IT READY - ICE IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE.\n\nBacon, Cheese & Egg Biscuit with no bacon, please.  It took them TWENTY minutes, FOUR different McD workers, and THREE breakfast sandwiches to get my friend's order right.  Not that difficult of an order - it doesn't mean a Sausage McMuffin without sausage; it doesn't mean a Bacon, Cheese & Egg Biscuit with egg; and it definitely doesn't mean a Sausage McMuffin without sausage, even the second time around.  \n\nDuring the BCE Biscuit incident, they still never gave me my coffee.  I politely informed the cashier, and the dude tells me he didn't forget it.  Let me guess, coffee beans aren't harvested yet and there wasn't even ice to try and trick me.  He then proceeded to pour me a cup.\n\nWhat a Mickey Mouse operation.  I will not come to this location again.\n\ndmo out.

Thank goodness for Michaels!\n\nWhere the \""semi-creative\"" can actually pull something together and create a masterpiece. Haha! \n\nI was \""tasked\"" (ugh) to pick up supplies for our pumpkin contest at work. We had a \""theme\"" (kinda)...but no clue of how to make that happen. Thank goodness the staff was helpful! Walking into Michaels can be a bit overwhelming...ok, extremely overwhelming, especially with a not well thought out vision. However, I'm pleased to say I managed to leave with some good stuff and my co-workers were happy.  \n\nSo then why just three stars??? Simply put this store is just way too cluttered. It's not necessarily the fault of the staff, they really have no control of people leaving stuff just anywhere but it can make it hard finding what you need when you have to dig through cards, glitter ornaments, plastic flowers and stickers. \n\nBut if you are every tasks out for work projects, I definitely recommend stopping here to get the creative juices flowing.

We had our wedding reception at lakeside grill for 50 people in the vista room.   Christina Telese was my contact for the event, and she was nothing short of fantastic.  She really helped me get everything together and I could not have done it without her.  \n\nWe chose this location based on a couple of things.  \n1.  SW would not accommodate a party our size \n2. We have eaten here before and liked the food, although the service left something to be desired\n3. It's a beautiful space in a beautiful hotel\n \nThe menu we chose was their priciest at $150.00 pp.  Mostly everything was great but there were some misses.  Our menu consisted of... \n\n*Antipasto including iberico ham, manchego cheese, marinated olives & bread -  this was a hit.  everything was delicious\n\n*Black Truffle Arancini -  Delicious and they went fast\n\n*Whipped garlic feta cheese with mushrooms and bread - Could have skipped it\n\nShellfish Platters - made up of the largest shrimp I have ever seen, lobster tails, oysters and Alaskan king crab legs.  These were awesome.  everything tasted fresh and great.  Nice portion for everyone at our table\n\nSalad Course was good, tomatoes, garbanzo beans, peppers, manchego \n\nKing Crab Risotto -  This dish was very rich and very tasty.  the risotto was perfectly cooked.\n\nOur entrees consisted of \nDover Sole - my guests who ordered this said it was OK and wished they got something else.  It was not prepared properly\n\nFilet and Lobster tail -  the filet was perfectly cooked as were the lobster tales but the tales were tiny.  I mean baby lobster tiny.  Still very good though. \n\nBone in NY Strip - The steak itself was very good, however, our guests did not get a choice on temperature.  So most were very rare.  I know that this is typical for most large parties but still.. \n\nFor dessert we had an assortment brought to each table.  Nothing was really a stand out unfortunately.  \n\nThe service for the most part was great, the beginning of the meal felt very rushed to me.  I'm not sure anyone else noticed but overall it was a fantastic meal.  I will definitely return.

It is not private, so if you are doing boudoir photos, I hope you're not exactly shy.  There's a partition up to shield it from the passing public's view, but there's no privacy if someone comes in to book an appointment, or even just stands in the hallway.  Not many people want to do boudoir photos and have them easily viewed by everyone that passes by.  The area in the back could have been set up as an additional viewing area, it would be more private, and cut down on waiting times.\n\nThere is only a set of curtains that is used when a session is going, and I witnessed a family passing by, and their child peeking in on people.  Again, I hope you're not shy!\n\nThis business needs a THOROUGH scrub down.  There was debris from different props all over the ground, the floor was scuffed up and dirty (and they expected you to sit on it in your panties if you were doing boudoir photos), there was a musty smell about the whole place, I can only imagine what would come up from the carpets in a proper cleaning, and the bathrooms were absolutely cringe worthy.  There was no attempt to clean the room between customers and the employees seemed to take no pride in their work place.  There were photographers and hair and makeup people sitting around.  No one cleaned anything, except the hair and makeup people keeping their stations tidy (good job ladies!)

If a doctor's office can ask this question, surely it's easy for a photography studio to ask!  The female photographer there that day (only one), was alright, but she really isn't well versed at photographing girls that are not on the skinny supermodel side of the size spectrum in a flattering light.  The male photographer that I had was annoying.  He asked inappropriate questions (like asking if my friend wanted to have children), and attempted to get me into poses that were uncomfortable.  I had to draw the line at a pose that would have had my breasts falling completely out of my outfit, the angle and pose was so unnatural.\n\nThe poses are all manufactured and the same for everyone.  Some of them are awkward and unnatural, leaving the person looking uncomfortable and maybe a little scared they're going to fall.  No wonder a lot of the terrible Glamour Shots poses from the 90's had people looking absolutely terrified.\n\nThe makeup is not tailored to each person.  They used the same neutral palette on both of us, and it's a normal 4 shades of brown application that one would do for a smoky eye.  When asked what we wanted for hair, I'm not sure what my friend said, but I know I said I was looking for a pin up, vintage style.  It was a side part with curls.  That's it.  Everyone got a side part with curls, so I suppose everyone was going for a pin up, vintage style that wasn't actually pin up or vintage?\n\nThe $450 value assigned to the groupon was bullshit.  No one would pay $300 for that dvd slideshow.  It's set to crappy music, the Glamour Shots logo is all over the photos (distractingly so), and it includes their \""retouched photos\"" which look overly processed and filtered.  Seriously, learn photoshop people!  I'm 30, I don't need to look 12 with you erasing all of my laugh lines and smoothing out my skin so I look like a Botoxed Barbie.  I would have gladly traded the dvd slideshow for more prints, but that was not an option.\n\nI did not spend any extra money there because I was so disappointed in the entire experience.

In the \""Fluffy & Folded\"" section you got your 3 egg omelettes, and my faves are The Denver with ham, bell peppers, onions, and cheese, or The Greek with spinach, tomatoes, and feta.  Yum!  \""Sin City Skillets\"" are for you wannabe cowboys who like your food coming in a cast-iron skillet, build your own or choose one off of their menu.  The last big breakfast section is \""From the Griddle\"" and includes their French toast choices as well as fresh pancakes.  From what I've tried and what I've heard...it's all pretty good stuff.  \n\nThe Cracked Egg also has non-breakfast stuff for you non-breakfast eaters too.  From sandwiches and salads, to burgers and homemade chili, it's all there.  But why come to a breakfast joint and not have breakfast?  It's like going to El Pollo Loco and asking for fish!  Try the breakfast.\n\nOnly gripe I have here is that the prices are a bit on the high side.  I could make some of these dishes at home easily for half the cost, and do just as good a job since I love making breakfast anyway.  Two folks eating breakfast with a cup of joe each will probably set you back $25+ after tax and tip depending on what you eat.  Worth it if you go every once in a while or on a special occasion.  Or if you're loaded like Steve Wynn.  Geez, that guy is rich.\n\nStop by The Cracked Egg, have a hearty breakfast, then bench press that little Fiat in the parking lot!

This place is LITERALLY on top of a nightclub. If you like feeling at 1:52am that you're in the middle of a party scene while laying in bed than this may be the place for you. Unfortunately for me I like to sleep. I will never stay here again.

We noticed that the waiter had been bringing baskets of warm bread to the tables earlier, so I asked if it would be possible to get some bread while we waited for our food.  The waiter explained that 1) they were out of bread and were waiting for more to be delivered and 2) that even if they had bread that the oven was being used for something else and our bread would be cold.  He explained that we were \""first\"" on his list for bread once they got more bread.  About 20 minutes later, he brought us bread...it was cold, along with the butter.

I wanted to redo all of the windows in my house and their designer Jan came to help me decide what to get.\n\nJan was rude, condescending and just snarky. I had to chase her back to her car, because I wasn't done. I really wanted the window coverings or would have given up. I decided to get shutters for the whole house, placed the order and put down the deposit.\n\nSeveral days later the installers called to schedule the measuring. I was driving so asked if they could call back in an hour or two when I was home. \n\nAfter we hung up I got another phone call, and when I answered it turned out one of the installers had butt-dialed me back by accident and I could hear them talking about me. Jan had told them seriously horrible things about me (we were together for like one hour with my then 18-month-old son at home) and I could hear them discussing it. Seriously? What could have happened in an hour with a lone woman and a young toddler? Jan was obviously uninterested in me as a customer, judgemental and the worse salesperson ever. The installers were saying how mean I was and I was mad because they called while I was driving. Really? What I said almost word for word was, \""I'm driving now and can't access my calendar which is on my computer at home. Can you call me back in an hour or two?\"".\n\nI was so mad I called the owner and cancelled my order and got my $3000 deposit back. Luckily I had paid by credit card so they had no choice but to give me my money back. \n\nFast forward to now, three years later. As of 1 month ago I still hadn't gotten the shutters I wanted because I was so irritated by the previous experience. But a month ago I finally bit the bullet and called Sunburst. What a refreshing change. The guys they sent out were nice and helpful. If they had any negative thoughts about me and my family they kept it professionally to themselves.

House of Window Coverings has the most unprofessional and unhelpful employees ever. I wanted to redo all of the windows in my house and their designer Jan came to help me decide what to get.\n\nJan was rude, condescending and just snarky. I had to chase her back to her car, because I wasn't done. I really wanted the window coverings or would have given up. I decided to get shutters for the whole house, placed the order and put down the deposit.\n\nSeveral days later the installers called to schedule the measuring. I was driving so asked if they could call back in an hour or two when I was home. \n\nAfter we hung up I got another phone call, and when I answered it turned out one of the installers had butt-dialed me back by accident and I could hear them talking about me. Jan had told them seriously horrible things about me (we were together for like one hour with my then 18-month-old son at home) and I could hear them discussing it. Seriously? What could have happened in an hour with a lone woman and a young toddler? Jan was obviously uninterested in me as a customer, judgemental and the worse salesperson ever. The installers were saying how mean I was and I was mad because they called while I was driving. Really? What I said almost word for word was, \""I'm driving now and can't access my calendar which is on my computer at home. Can you call me back in an hour or two?\"".\n\nI was so mad I called the owner and cancelled my order and got my $3000 deposit back. Luckily I had paid by credit card so they had no choice but to give me my money back. \n\nFast forward to now, three years later. As of 1 month ago I still hadn't gotten the shutters I wanted because I was so irritated by the previous experience. But a month ago I finally bit the bullet and called Sunburst. What a refreshing change. The guys they sent out were nice and helpful. If they had any negative thoughts about me and my family they kept it professionally to themselves.  My beautiful new shutters, complete with lifetime guarantee, were installed by two very nice and professional guys and look wonderful.\n\nI probably should be grateful about the bad experience I had BEFORE the shutters were really ordered.

I then see the waitress at the computer assuming maybe she is preparing my check.  Wait. wait. wait.  Others at the table are getting annoyed too.  So I take my two pancakes on a plate up to the waitress.  I said I would like a box and my check please.  She is lost in a fog.  I said please get me a box and my check.  Again lost in fog.  I hand the plate to her and said I will meet you up front at the register.  I tipped her too and I really don't know why.  Should it take 2 hours to eat in an empty restuarant?   What I really meant to say was are you supposed to wait for an hour after you eat to get the check??

I've yet to try Pizzeria Bianco (one of these days!) but as this place shares the same owner, I found that grabbing a sandwich here is much less of a hassle than waiting in line for a pizza at PB.   Never thought twice about making the trip out from Peoria for lunch, either.\n\nThe word is that the owner is very fastidious when it comes to food thus he only uses fresh, local ingredients--often from his own garden.  Taste one of the sandwiches to find out for yourself!\n\nSeriously though, how many places can you go where the owner is the one responsible for baking the bread for YOUR sandwich?  Not many.  But here he will.  So what if I was a tad celeb-struck, at least I didn't embarrass myself by waving and shouting at him.  Meh, he's probably used to it.

Check-in service was painless albeit it was a weekend day afternoon and not very busy.\n\nWe were really impressed by the ambience of the hotel room (resort room with a view of the Strip). The modern decor matched our tastes. There was a flat screen tv with a Bose wave sound clock radio.  The bed, covered with plush pillows and fresh linens, was comfortable. The bathroom was great - two vanity sinks with an integrated tv (which had bad reception), enclosed granite shower, a bathtub with a view of the Strip (and a electronic privacy shade if you desire). Complementary cards were included in the suite. Maid service was excellent.\n\nUse of the fitness area costs $15 and internet costs $13/day which seemed rather pricey to me. I'll post a pic of the spa prices (note: they charge you a mandatory 20% gratuity!).\n\nThe amenities include use of the pool area which was lovely. We enjoyed lazing around the pool all afternoon like two slugs. It was awesome! The crowd there is diverse - you see kids in their lifejackets, the elderly sunning next to their wheelchairs and the young 20 somethings sporting designer shades and swimwear.

The Skinny: Nice hotel, great place to stay even though there isn't much to do other than go to the spa, stay by the pool, eat or gamble - but there's nothing wrong with that(4.5).\n\nWe stayed here for two weekday nights in August for a brief staycation. Check-in service was painless albeit it was a weekend day afternoon and not very busy.\n\nWe were really impressed by the ambience of the hotel room (resort room with a view of the Strip). The modern decor matched our tastes. There was a flat screen tv with a Bose wave sound clock radio.  The bed, covered with plush pillows and fresh linens, was comfortable. The bathroom was great - two vanity sinks with an integrated tv (which had bad reception), enclosed granite shower, a bathtub with a view of the Strip (and a electronic privacy shade if you desire). Complementary cards were included in the suite. Maid service was excellent.\n\nUse of the fitness area costs $15 and internet costs $13/day which seemed rather pricey to me. I'll post a pic of the spa prices (note: they charge you a mandatory 20% gratuity!).\n\nThe amenities include use of the pool area which was lovely. We enjoyed lazing around the pool all afternoon like two slugs. It was awesome! The crowd there is diverse - you see kids in their lifejackets, the elderly sunning next to their wheelchairs and the young 20 somethings sporting designer shades and swimwear.

As we waited for our food  the rude bouncers came and asked us to get up and move to the next table, we did, then a few minutes later, they told us they needed the chairs we were sitting on, and they took those as well. At this point our table had been pushed completely In front of a hugeee fan, & we had no chairs. While standing around like fools & telling the bouncer had food coming,the bouncer said he would get us chairs & turn the fan off- it never happened. The next part is what ticked me off- the server brought our food and placed it right in front of the fan, allowing dirt & dust\nTo be blown on it, not to mention the cheese on my pizza coagulated within seconds. 10 mins after the food was just laying around . At this point I refused to eat the food & continued to finish my drink & asked for the bill to pay for my drinks. This is quite funny, I get the bill and they had charged me for my the food as well. Not one apology, not one 'let me see if I can find a table'. The server was nice enough to bring us 2 free beers which I didn't even touch because I was soo annoyed. But overall it was an unpleasant experience.

This process will include working out the deal over the phone....The below story can be summed up with Airpark's final statement to me as \""...if you do not finance through us we don't want your business and we want you to leave\""\n\nIn any case,  Airpark Dodge made this the most adversarial car purchasing experience I have ever had.  They are, in my opinion, the most extremely aggressive, misleading, non-scrupulous and untrustworthy dealership I have ever run across.  They wasted a full day of my time and I suggest, prior to going, you tread lightly and consider about anyplace else.\n\n***********************\nDuring the entire 24 hour process (to the hour) we were extremely clear we had our own financing with an extremely good rate (one they would either not beat or could barely match). In any case we clearly stated we are simply there to purchase the vehicle only and for the amount we required.  It was very clear nothing less than these statements would be acceptable and we wanted a quick and easy transaction.\n\nWe started the day with the requirements stated and accepted over the phone.  All we needed was the purchase agreement from them. And we would be on our way to the bank to pick up the check and make our purchase.\n\nWithout going into the line by line issues I will simply state a full day of \""misunderstandings\"" on totals, rebates, sums, flaws and missteps occurred.  They continuously sent incorrect data to give to the bank.  Not only incorrect data but incorrect paperwork.  It was extremely clear as to what we were looking for.  I find it very hard to believe they have never dealt with a customer in this manner.\n\nIt became obvious I would have to go and get it from them physically (which ends out being exactly what they wanted). Upon arrival the salesman attempted to have me sign all their standard applications for credit (of which I, again, clearly stated I wanted no part of).  In fact at one point he attempted to convince me it was for the purchase only that he required this information (this included my ssn).... I may be dense but not that dense and I clarified my position by statingif I gave you my ssn you do not have permission to run my credit.... Funny, he no longer cared to get that filled out and ran off to see his manager (and I had no intention of giving this to him anyhow)\n\nThe finance manager got into the mix, actually had the nerve to ask me to explain what the problem was.  After spending the last day working on this I was not about to describe the events of the day.  This particular question was a bit misleading as shortly after he talked as though he was fully versed in the situation.  I am pretty sure he was not fully versed in my particular situation, I sincerely believe he was versed in the script written for our particular purchasing requirement.\n\nWell as we know they said they don't want our business if we are not going to finance through them.  They also mentioned we will receive a negative review anyhow.... Guess they didn't think of yelp.\n\nI know I should have left sooner but was stuck on the good price I worked out......Really should have left sooner.\n\n.... And the rest of the story....\nThe next day we went to Chapman Dodge....the acquired the exact same (physically the same) vehicle and sold it to us for exactly our asking price.  The purchase experience was exactly what I hoped for, very smooth, no pressure, no worries.

I rented a mid sized car from them a week ago for my birthday weekend in Las Vegas. \n\nDO NOT RENT FROM DOLLAR EVER.     \n\nThey seemed to be the only antiquated rental agency with no self-service kioks.

I really wish Yelp would allow zero stars.\n\n\nSince Airpark Dodge is local We figured it would be a great place to go purchase our exact specification of a Jeep Grand Cherokee for exactly the cost we investigated as fair.\n\nWe attempted to make this purchase at Airpark Dodge using our own funding.  This process will include working out the deal over the phone....The below story can be summed up with Airpark's final statement to me as \""...if you do not finance through us we don't want your business and we want you to leave\""\n\nIn any case,  Airpark Dodge made this the most adversarial car purchasing experience I have ever had.  They are, in my opinion, the most extremely aggressive, misleading, non-scrupulous and untrustworthy dealership I have ever run across.  They wasted a full day of my time and I suggest, prior to going, you tread lightly and consider about anyplace else.\n\n***********************\nDuring the entire 24 hour process (to the hour) we were extremely clear we had our own financing with an extremely good rate (one they would either not beat or could barely match). In any case we clearly stated we are simply there to purchase the vehicle only and for the amount we required.  It was very clear nothing less than these statements would be acceptable and we wanted a quick and easy transaction.\n\nWe started the day with the requirements stated and accepted over the phone.  All we needed was the purchase agreement from them. And we would be on our way to the bank to pick up the check and make our purchase.\n\nWithout going into the line by line issues I will simply state a full day of \""misunderstandings\"" on totals, rebates, sums, flaws and missteps occurred.  They continuously sent incorrect data to give to the bank.  Not only incorrect data but incorrect paperwork.  It was extremely clear as to what we were looking for.  I find it very hard to believe they have never dealt with a customer in this manner.\n\nIt became obvious I would have to go and get it from them physically (which ends out being exactly what they wanted). Upon arrival the salesman attempted to have me sign all their standard applications for credit (of which I, again, clearly stated I wanted no part of).  In fact at one point he attempted to convince me it was for the purchase only that he required this information (this included my ssn).... I may be dense but not that dense and I clarified my position by statingif I gave you my ssn you do not have permission to run my credit.... Funny, he no longer cared to get that filled out and ran off to see his manager (and I had no intention of giving this to him anyhow)\n\nThe finance manager got into the mix, actually had the nerve to ask me to explain what the problem was.  After spending the last day working on this I was not about to describe the events of the day.  This particular question was a bit misleading as shortly after he talked as though he was fully versed in the situation.  I am pretty sure he was not fully versed in my particular situation, I sincerely believe he was versed in the script written for our particular purchasing requirement.\n\nWell as we know they said they don't want our business if we are not going to finance through them.  They also mentioned we will receive a negative review anyhow.... Guess they didn't think of yelp.\n\nI know I should have left sooner but was stuck on the good price I worked out......Really should have left sooner.\n\n.... And the rest of the story....\nThe next day we went to Chapman Dodge....the acquired the exact same (physically the same) vehicle and sold it to us for exactly our asking price.  The purchase experience was exactly what I hoped for, very smooth, no pressure, no worries.  I was very clear on what we wanted and the abided by our decisions and processed the paperwork for which we required.  \n\nI highly recommend you consider going to Chapman Dodge as you first attempt to purchase your vehicle.

The same waiter (I didn't get his name) has served my table several times and he is topnotch. It's a good place to have a drink and relax.\n\nI like the green rice and boiled whole pinto beans.

We ate breakfast here; it was tasty and very budget friendly. Johnny Rockets is also located on the casino floor, but we did not eat here on this trip. The flagship of the Silverton dining experience is Twin Creeks- which is an absolute must-visit during your trip. It has a beautifully romantic ambiance, and serves upscale steakhouse fare at prices much lower than similar restaurants on the Strip. The Tomahawk Rib Eye was simply divine! I just can't say enough about this incredible restaurant and the amazing staff.\nThe Silverton is connected to a Bass Pro Shop. If you are into that kind of thing, this store is huge and gorgeous.

Upon our arrival at around 11am, we had practically no wait for service, and the front desk clerk had no problem giving us an early check in time. All the housekeeping staff made sure to say hello anytime they walked by, and all of the wait staff members in the restaurants were attentive and friendly.

Pros:  Its cheap, and its the only pyramid shaped hotel in Vegas. The casino and other general areas of the hotel are well maintained, good location.\n\nCons:  Rooms are dated and not very clean including the bathroom, furniture falling apart, hole in the wall, flickering lights, shower turns off for no reason, toilets that don't flush.  The elevators in the pyramid are nauseating.\n\nAs I stated earlier, its cheap and you get what you pay for.  Not horrible, but I will not be back at least as an overnight guest.  You can find other bargains on the strip with better quality.

I merely wandered in and right back out. \n\nGone is the crowd and the long wait on a weekend morning waiting for a Pischke's greasy and tasty breakfast. Gone is the kitschy decor that gave the place character. Gone are the sassy waitresses who looked like they needed a good night sleep. Gone are the bursting menus full of good eats at reasonable prices.\n\nReplacing all of this is a bland and boring decor, 50% fewer menu choices, and 50% higher prices. The place was pretty empty while every other breakfast place in the neighborhood (we drove past 5 others) was packed with a line going out the door. Here's a tip for Mr Robert McGrath - if you buy a successful restaurant, don't make drastic changes and jack up the prices... in other words - if it ain't broke, don't fix it. \n\nI'm actually kinda pissed too because I thought Pischke's was pretty good and it was definitely adding character to our city... what's there now is just another boring restaurant. There's plenty of those around here... Pischke's was unique to the area. When I visit my sister in Minnesota, she has some really neat breakfast places she takes me to that are decorated as an eclectic mess, but that blow you away with good greasy food and are dripping with atmosphere and fun. Same story when I go to San Diego or Long Beach to visit friends. Neat hip cities have neat hip breakfast joints. Well now we have one fewer. \n\nIt's true - I haven't eaten here and perhaps Robert McGrath makes the most bomb-ass bacon and eggs this side of the equator... but it would seriously have to blow my mind to put this place back on my list of places to go.

I must agree with Scott S, but I should point out that I'm probably even less qualified to write a review of this place as I didn't eat here... I merely wandered in and right back out. \n\nGone is the crowd and the long wait on a weekend morning waiting for a Pischke's greasy and tasty breakfast. Gone is the kitschy decor that gave the place character. Gone are the sassy waitresses who looked like they needed a good night sleep. Gone are the bursting menus full of good eats at reasonable prices.\n\nReplacing all of this is a bland and boring decor, 50% fewer menu choices, and 50% higher prices. The place was pretty empty while every other breakfast place in the neighborhood (we drove past 5 others) was packed with a line going out the door. Here's a tip for Mr Robert McGrath - if you buy a successful restaurant, don't make drastic changes and jack up the prices... in other words - if it ain't broke, don't fix it. \n\nI'm actually kinda pissed too because I thought Pischke's was pretty good and it was definitely adding character to our city... what's there now is just another boring restaurant. There's plenty of those around here... Pischke's was unique to the area. When I visit my sister in Minnesota, she has some really neat breakfast places she takes me to that are decorated as an eclectic mess, but that blow you away with good greasy food and are dripping with atmosphere and fun. Same story when I go to San Diego or Long Beach to visit friends. Neat hip cities have neat hip breakfast joints. Well now we have one fewer. \n\nIt's true - I haven't eaten here and perhaps Robert McGrath makes the most bomb-ass bacon and eggs this side of the equator... but it would seriously have to blow my mind to put this place back on my list of places to go. The empty seats told me the story anyway. Before I left, I told the hostess to put it back the way it was. \n\nI plan to actually have a meal there sometime and then post a proper review... until then, this will have to do.

0,"Still a fan here!  Shop Cardenas weekly to get dinner goods for Taco Night at our house!  This place is close to my work so I'm here at least twice a week for cheap produce and reasonably priced meats.  The selection is still great, and I've noticed over the months that more and more non-Latinos shop here!  Good job people!  Cheapy like me!  Their produce prices sure beat the local Albertson's and Vons and Smith's by a long shot.  The only other place I get veggies is the Asian market but that's only because those yummy types of veggies aren't found here at Cardenas.  Go ahead, ask the stocker where they keep the baby bok choy and the fragrant pears!  You will get a look of confusion.  Well, that could also be because the stocker doesn't understand English very well.  In either case, you're out of luck.\n\nCardenas is still mostly one stop shop for your Mexican needs.  Besides the large supermarket area, you still have your juice bar, bakery, deli, and tortilleria stations within the store.  The tortillas here are pretty good, I'm spoiled now...I only buy fresh made corn tortillas from the tortilleria for my tacos!  They taste 100 times better when they are made only a few hours ago.  Really makes a difference in your Mexican dishes.\n\nThe juice bar is tasty, with fresh concoctions of strawberry and watermelon juices, or a fresh fruit smoothie.  It's better if you know a bit of Spanish because the drink orders can get confusing.  Got what I thought was supposed to be a strawberry smoothie, but they for some reason added beets!  Tastier than I thought it would be but still, could have done without them.\n\nCardenas bakery goes all day long.  When you enter the store you constantly smell the aroma of fresh bread or pastries coming out of the oven.  Tip, always ask for the freshest stuff out of the ovens (usually will be on trays where the ovens are).  I find that sometimes the pastries in the case can be sitting there for a while, and Lord knows who's been touching them or who's kids boogie face got on them.  A sign that says 'Please use tongs' doesn't always fit the bill!\n\nI am often here for a quick lunch at the Cardenas deli, especially when they run their weekly specials.  $5 sale for a burrito al pastor?  $3 for a ham torta?  Often with a free drink?  I'm there!  I enjoy most of the fare at Cardenas, and it's great they have a free salsa bar to partake with each meal.  As of late, they have taken out the sliced cucumbers and sliced radishes that used to be regulars at the bar...but it's ok.  They probably had to because of food cost, or because of people like me who love to stock up for some healthy snacking!  No problem though, looks like more pickled jalapenos for me!

This place is delicious! Enjoyed it for the first time one week ago and I had to go back for seconds today. They accept cards now which is great, as I've heard they only took cash in the past.

Still a fan here!  Shop Cardenas weekly to get dinner goods for Taco Night at our house!  This place is close to my work so I'm here at least twice a week for cheap produce and reasonably priced meats.  The selection is still great, and I've noticed over the months that more and more non-Latinos shop here!  Good job people!  Cheapy like me!  Their produce prices sure beat the local Albertson's and Vons and Smith's by a long shot.  The only other place I get veggies is the Asian market but that's only because those yummy types of veggies aren't found here at Cardenas.  Go ahead, ask the stocker where they keep the baby bok choy and the fragrant pears!  You will get a look of confusion.  Well, that could also be because the stocker doesn't understand English very well.  In either case, you're out of luck.\n\nCardenas is still mostly one stop shop for your Mexican needs.  Besides the large supermarket area, you still have your juice bar, bakery, deli, and tortilleria stations within the store.  The tortillas here are pretty good, I'm spoiled now...I only buy fresh made corn tortillas from the tortilleria for my tacos!  They taste 100 times better when they are made only a few hours ago.  Really makes a difference in your Mexican dishes.\n\nThe juice bar is tasty, with fresh concoctions of strawberry and watermelon juices, or a fresh fruit smoothie.  It's better if you know a bit of Spanish because the drink orders can get confusing.  Got what I thought was supposed to be a strawberry smoothie, but they for some reason added beets!  Tastier than I thought it would be but still, could have done without them.\n\nCardenas bakery goes all day long.  When you enter the store you constantly smell the aroma of fresh bread or pastries coming out of the oven.  Tip, always ask for the freshest stuff out of the ovens (usually will be on trays where the ovens are).  I find that sometimes the pastries in the case can be sitting there for a while, and Lord knows who's been touching them or who's kids boogie face got on them.  A sign that says 'Please use tongs' doesn't always fit the bill!\n\nI am often here for a quick lunch at the Cardenas deli, especially when they run their weekly specials.  $5 sale for a burrito al pastor?  $3 for a ham torta?  Often with a free drink?  I'm there!  I enjoy most of the fare at Cardenas, and it's great they have a free salsa bar to partake with each meal.  As of late, they have taken out the sliced cucumbers and sliced radishes that used to be regulars at the bar...but it's ok.  They probably had to because of food cost, or because of people like me who love to stock up for some healthy snacking!  No problem though, looks like more pickled jalapenos for me!  I am probably there for food at least 5-6 times a month.  I love me a torta with a mix of tomatillo salsa and Cardenas hot sauce for dipping.  MUY DELICIOSO!\n\nCheap and easy, that's my motto.

0,"Location: hidden in a small complex near a salon, subway, and next door to Bachi Burger. \n\nAfter our party was waiting for what seemed an eternity at Bachi Burger, we decided to go to its sister place, Ramen Shoku.  Simply put, I most likely, not probably, won't be back here again. The various appetizers including the GYOZA and TAKOYAKI was somewhat interesting, but nothing too exciting to do an order of again.  Each of us  had something different...TONKOTSU, SPICY MISO, and I had the most touted TAN TAN MEN ramen for 11.50.  It was overly salty and the noodles were too al dente.  I couldn't get past the overly salty taste of the soup and it seemed that every time I had the soup, I would be grappling for the water as a chaser.  The menu stated spciy base, but they need to edit it and put salty base.

Location: hidden in a small complex near a salon, subway, and next door to Bachi Burger. \n\nAfter our party was waiting for what seemed an eternity at Bachi Burger, we decided to go to its sister place, Ramen Shoku.  Simply put, I most likely, not probably, won't be back here again. The various appetizers including the GYOZA and TAKOYAKI was somewhat interesting, but nothing too exciting to do an order of again.  Each of us  had something different...TONKOTSU, SPICY MISO, and I had the most touted TAN TAN MEN ramen for 11.50.  It was overly salty and the noodles were too al dente.  I couldn't get past the overly salty taste of the soup and it seemed that every time I had the soup, I would be grappling for the water as a chaser.  The menu stated spciy base, but they need to edit it and put salty base.  I almost wanted to add the carafe of water into the soup and ask them to heat the soup along with the al dente noodles to cook some more.

Good: \n + Excellent kiddie island - 4 stories of much fun and usable by adults.\n+ Very good set of toddler slides (choice of 4)\n+ New facility - opened in May 2013\n+ Excellent swimmer to lifeguard ratio\n+ Super fun rides including a slide racer where 5-6 sliders race down the watery rainbow slope\n+ Food taste - had a very tasty chicken teriyaki sandwich\n+ There are some water misters in the wait lines to keep you cool\n+ An excellent adjacent public park was fun to play in after we left the swimpark for the day\n\nBad:\n - Location. This new location is far, far off the Strip and requires a long drive to get there. Back parking lot is a hike to the front.\n - Cost. Everything costs so much - extra for parking, extra for tube rental, expensive locker rental, extra expense for line-jumping pass, extremely costly charge ($150) for cabana rental. This is on top of the hefty $40 per adult charge.\n - Changing Rooms. Little to no clothes changing stalls in both male and female bathrooms; very few showers.\n - Entry. Entrances to the wave pool and lazy river are narrow and cause congestion\n - Tubes. You have to haul your own float tube to the top of the rides - no conveyor belt to assist in getting the tube to the top\n - Wait time - longish lines (without the line jump band) meant a long wait between fun rides.\n - Special salt water conditioning system in pools is harsh on swim suits - my daughter's dark pink suit came home very light pink\n\nTip:\n* Take your own shade and chairs - those are in short supply\n* Be sure to wear flip-flops or watershoes to all the rides - there is a LOT of non-shaded cement and it gets very hot.

The beef had large veins of grizzle running down almost every bite.  The breaded chicken was so tough I couldn't finish it.  It was as if they took some frozen, breaded chicken out of a freezer from months of sitting and microwaved it on high until it was over cooked.  I am writing this at 4:24 am because I can't sleep due to the queasiness in my stomach that has lasted roughly 8 hours.  Being a slave to the limited delivery in the Charlotte region certainly takes it's toll.

Gather around kids and let Uncle Rex tell you a story...when Rex was a small child he spent many a month on the East Coast. It was a magical time.  My father, who beat young Rex mercilessly if Rex called him anything but \""The Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora\"", was originally from the Northeast.  My father was an odd man, a brutal man, a man with big dreams and small child like hands.  On my fifth birthday he brought Rex with him as he knocked over a 7-11.  As Rex helped him tie up the store clerk he let me pick any one thing Rex wanted in the store.  Young Rex wandered around the store, trying very hard to not step in the pools of blood, Rex saw the object he wanted...Rex turned and said \""Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora can Rex have THAT?\""  He nodded.  Rex kicked the 87 year old man laying on some of it...and picked it up. It was a bag with a delicious cheesesteak in it.  Rex danced. Rex smiled. Rex took the wallet of a crying soccer dad.  Rex was happy.  Rex and Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora drove down the street, the sound of sirens in the distance fading...the smell of the cheesesteak wafting into Rex's young nasal passages.  A great cheesesteak is a gift from above.  A wallet filled with 20 dollar bills and an unused condom...icing on the cake.  After we divided the ill gotten booty, Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora always took 70% (until I turned 9...but that is another story)...Rex ate his cheesesteak.  Perfect bread. Juicy shredded meat. Perfectly cooked onions. The right amount of whiz. Juice ran down Rex's chin. Juice ran down Rex's hands. Rex shook in delight. That memory, and the 8 months Rex spent on the run after Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora ratted him out...will always be with him.\n\nPops Philly Cheesesteak is not only an insult to that memory it is an insult to all things with meat, cheese, bread or even hot foods.  The front page of the their website has a picture of their pitiful attempt of a cheeesteak...one of one of their abominations has green pepper on it. GREEN PEPPER!!  Let me explain something to all of you who are not from Philly...IF there was a place in Philadelphia that put green bell peppers on their cheeseteak...THE CITIZENS WOULD BURN IT DOWN!!!  It is ABSOLUTLEY 100% NOT ALLOWED IN ANY PLACE IN PHILADELPHIA!! Even if asked they WILL NOT DO IT!  So, first and foremost this is NOT A PHILLY CHEESESTEAK PLACE!!! IT IS NOT! END OF STORY!\n\nApologies. Rex passed out and needed a shot of \""Happy Serum\"" to get up right again...what is \""Happy Serum\"" you ask...heathen...it is 1 part gasoline, 1 part peach schnapps, 1 part wiper fluid. \n\nAnyway, now that we have established this is not a Philly cheesesteak, let's talk about it from a cheesesteak on it's own merits.

In the worst of times people often think of the best of times.  Rex is no exception.  Gather around kids and let Uncle Rex tell you a story...when Rex was a small child he spent many a month on the East Coast. It was a magical time.  My father, who beat young Rex mercilessly if Rex called him anything but \""The Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora\"", was originally from the Northeast.  My father was an odd man, a brutal man, a man with big dreams and small child like hands.  On my fifth birthday he brought Rex with him as he knocked over a 7-11.  As Rex helped him tie up the store clerk he let me pick any one thing Rex wanted in the store.  Young Rex wandered around the store, trying very hard to not step in the pools of blood, Rex saw the object he wanted...Rex turned and said \""Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora can Rex have THAT?\""  He nodded.  Rex kicked the 87 year old man laying on some of it...and picked it up. It was a bag with a delicious cheesesteak in it.  Rex danced. Rex smiled. Rex took the wallet of a crying soccer dad.  Rex was happy.  Rex and Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora drove down the street, the sound of sirens in the distance fading...the smell of the cheesesteak wafting into Rex's young nasal passages.  A great cheesesteak is a gift from above.  A wallet filled with 20 dollar bills and an unused condom...icing on the cake.  After we divided the ill gotten booty, Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora always took 70% (until I turned 9...but that is another story)...Rex ate his cheesesteak.  Perfect bread. Juicy shredded meat. Perfectly cooked onions. The right amount of whiz. Juice ran down Rex's chin. Juice ran down Rex's hands. Rex shook in delight. That memory, and the 8 months Rex spent on the run after Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora ratted him out...will always be with him.\n\nPops Philly Cheesesteak is not only an insult to that memory it is an insult to all things with meat, cheese, bread or even hot foods.  The front page of the their website has a picture of their pitiful attempt of a cheeesteak...one of one of their abominations has green pepper on it. GREEN PEPPER!!  Let me explain something to all of you who are not from Philly...IF there was a place in Philadelphia that put green bell peppers on their cheeseteak...THE CITIZENS WOULD BURN IT DOWN!!!  It is ABSOLUTLEY 100% NOT ALLOWED IN ANY PLACE IN PHILADELPHIA!! Even if asked they WILL NOT DO IT!  So, first and foremost this is NOT A PHILLY CHEESESTEAK PLACE!!! IT IS NOT! END OF STORY!\n\nApologies. Rex passed out and needed a shot of \""Happy Serum\"" to get up right again...what is \""Happy Serum\"" you ask...heathen...it is 1 part gasoline, 1 part peach schnapps, 1 part wiper fluid. \n\nAnyway, now that we have established this is not a Philly cheesesteak, let's talk about it from a cheesesteak on it's own merits.  First, the rolls are good, the sad part is you can tell the bread is shipped frozen or frozen after it gets to Pops.  Big mistake. It really messes with the bread. It isn't bad, but again it isn't East Coast good.  Cheese...never enough. Never. If you get provolone instead of whiz it is almost non-existent. Shame on you for skimping on the cheese.

I'm always looking for a new spot to try and this place is about a mile from my house. We came in during happy hour and the place was pretty dead. Our server was nice and very attentive, but can tell he was bored with his lack of tables because he came over every 5 minutes. Food choices are American (burgers, salads, sandwiches). We ordered beers, which were $5 for craft beer pints. Beer choices here are good. For HH prices though, I wasn't too impressed. Appetizers are still between $5-10.\n\nFor dinner, I ordered the Wrangler burger and fries. I was told to stay far away from the coleslaw, as recommended by our server. My boyfriend ordered the philly cheesesteak and fries. Food arrived and mine tasted fine. My boyfriend said his philly was very dry and the bread was clearly burnt. He couldn't wait to leave. I can't say my burger was bad because it wasn't. I liked the egg bun too. Fries were not warm though and that was a bummer.\n\nWe didn't get dessert, just the check. We left for about $30. Sorry TapHouse but we won't be back. Nothing special here

Big props for making these two customers feel happy about that.  One thing, my sausage did end up looking like bacon...but I ate it anyway.\n\nOK, so this has to be categorized as a down, there's no way to put a happy spin on it.  The bathrooms...what in the world went on in the bathroom?  It looks as if somebody was having a battle royale in the one.  Maybe somebody was fighting a demon much like they do in the show Charmed.  I mean thank god I didn't mistake the Styrofoam cups for having anything else but soap in them.  Also, this place is really showing it's wear.  It hasn't been open that long, but it sure needs a bit of TLC and updating.

Let me start by saying WORST CUPCAKES EVER!  Seriously.  I'm not trying to be mean, but they were really the worst cupcakes I've ever eaten.  First of all they looked very unprofessional, I seriously think my 7 year old grand daughter could have baked and decorated better cupcakes!  The taste was very bland, poorly decorated and just plain BORING!  Don't waste your money on this crap.  Girls... maybe you should take up watching CUPCAKES WARS or take a professional baking class... just a thought.  Needless to say I will NEVER eat these again and NEVER recommend them! OVER PRICED AND DULL!

(1 hour body & 1/2 hour foot massage) We arrive at 8:32 and start filling out forms.  My wife's 1st question SPECIFICALLY asks for a strong therapist.  The receptionist says yes, there is a strong therapist.  My wife's 2nd question was if the therapist was Thai; the receptionist says no, they are Chinese...BUT they've been trained by a Thai therapist.  I have nothing against Chinese therapists (I am Chinese) when I am getting a Chinese massage.  The techniques are worlds apart.  The receptionist continues to say it's OK, many customers ask for these therapists, they are good, etc...\n\nSo we make the wrong choice and continue.\n\nWe change into their shirt and pants and lie down on the mat.  My massage starts with a foot rub and pressing on my legs.  Not much of a massage just kind of squeezing on my muscles.  Continued onto the rest of my legs.  After that she started to pull and bend my legs.  Not much pressure was being applied so I'm not sure what this \""exercise\"" was about.  Not much changed for the duration of the 1 hour.  A lot of of just lightly rubbing and petting like other Yelpers mentioned.  Rubbed my scalp, my ears, my back, my neck and my arms a few times.  Pulled on my fingers...THIS WAS NOT A MASSAGE.\nNow onto the last 1/2 hour, the foot massage.  The therapists actually switched at this point!  I didn't know what's going on until later.  Much of the same thing, squeezing my foot here and there and that's about it.\n\nMy wife is fuming about her massage while we're changing back to our clothes. \n\nFor her first hour, she had to tell the therapist where to massage and she needed to be stronger.  Nothing relaxing about this at all.  Kept telling her stronger, the therapist would press a little harder once or twice.  This one didn't have a clue of how or where to massage.  This went on for an hour.\nSo the therapists decide that they need to switch because the one massaging my wife was getting tired from using all her strength...WT??  My therapist had more energy because she was just squeezing my arms & legs, they switch so I get the tired therapist to massage my feet.  \nThe last 1/2 hour for my wife was exactly like mine, just a foot squeeze.\n\nSo we go to the front counter to tell the receptionist of what just happened.  She actually said to us, \""we came in too late in the day, all the therapists are tired.  It's time for them to go home.\""  If we knew this, we would not have even came here at all. I don't know why, but we paid and gave a tip...\n\nSo the next morning, I call and look for someone to talk to about my experience.  I called their other location and talked to a \""manager\"".  She took my number and said she'll call the \""general manager\"".\nI get a call and talk to this man and he said sorry I can't help you, you stayed for the 1.5 hours so I can't do anything for you.  I explained that what we received was not a massage and I shouldn't have to pay for this.\nHe said if the therapists used more strength, they can get in trouble if they hurt their customers.  I said they weren't even massaging their customers!  \nThis man is very impolite and did not care about customer service at all.  He hung up on me.\nOh yeah, he said we got a 20% new customer discount...we got a good price. Yeah right.\n\nPass on this place.

The receptionist says yes, there is a strong therapist.  My wife's 2nd question was if the therapist was Thai; the receptionist says no, they are Chinese...BUT they've been trained by a Thai therapist.  I have nothing against Chinese therapists (I am Chinese) when I am getting a Chinese massage.  The techniques are worlds apart.  The receptionist continues to say it's OK, many customers ask for these therapists, they are good, etc...\n\nSo we make the wrong choice and continue.\n\nWe change into their shirt and pants and lie down on the mat.  My massage starts with a foot rub and pressing on my legs.  Not much of a massage just kind of squeezing on my muscles.  Continued onto the rest of my legs.  After that she started to pull and bend my legs.  Not much pressure was being applied so I'm not sure what this \""exercise\"" was about.  Not much changed for the duration of the 1 hour.  A lot of of just lightly rubbing and petting like other Yelpers mentioned.  Rubbed my scalp, my ears, my back, my neck and my arms a few times.  Pulled on my fingers...THIS WAS NOT A MASSAGE.\nNow onto the last 1/2 hour, the foot massage.  The therapists actually switched at this point!  I didn't know what's going on until later.  Much of the same thing, squeezing my foot here and there and that's about it.\n\nMy wife is fuming about her massage while we're changing back to our clothes. \n\nFor her first hour, she had to tell the therapist where to massage and she needed to be stronger.  Nothing relaxing about this at all.  Kept telling her stronger, the therapist would press a little harder once or twice.  This one didn't have a clue of how or where to massage.  This went on for an hour.\nSo the therapists decide that they need to switch because the one massaging my wife was getting tired from using all her strength...WT??  My therapist had more energy because she was just squeezing my arms & legs, they switch so I get the tired therapist to massage my feet.  \nThe last 1/2 hour for my wife was exactly like mine, just a foot squeeze.\n\nSo we go to the front counter to tell the receptionist of what just happened.  She actually said to us, \""we came in too late in the day, all the therapists are tired.  It's time for them to go home.\""  If we knew this, we would not have even came here at all. I don't know why, but we paid and gave a tip...\n\nSo the next morning, I call and look for someone to talk to about my experience.  I called their other location and talked to a \""manager\"".  She took my number and said she'll call the \""general manager\"".\nI get a call and talk to this man and he said sorry I can't help you, you stayed for the 1.5 hours so I can't do anything for you.  I explained that what we received was not a massage and I shouldn't have to pay for this.\nHe said if the therapists used more strength, they can get in trouble if they hurt their customers.  I said they weren't even massaging their customers!  \nThis man is very impolite and did not care about customer service at all.  He hung up on me.\nOh yeah, he said we got a 20% new customer discount...we got a good price. Yeah right.\n\nPass on this place.  Unprofessional and bad service.\n\nToo bad this is the only Thai massage in PHX.

we had 20 chicken wings and the prime rib dinner with a sprite for ~20 on a friday night (3am).\n\n- chicken wings are a bit oily. after a few, it becomes hard to eat. oil overwhelms the flavor. medium taste like regular fried chicken without sauce. \n- 10 wings for 2.50. can only get them 10 at a time. 25 cents only for owl club members you have to get a drink to get it also.\n- prime rib was a bit rubbery and cold. mash potatoes were pretty good. green beans were a bit disgusting, tasted like it came out from a can. \n- friendly and fast service.

Do not be lured in to this hotel by its cheap rates and \""newly remodeled\"" room pictures!!  \n\nMaybe some people will call me a hotel snob after reading my review.

The rooms are repainted and floors were redone, and new beds. That's only the best part.\nThey have new vinyl wooden floor, no carpet except a small rug in the walk way.

Here are the highs and lows:\n\nPROS:\n-Very attentive and friendly staff at the front desk\n-The Griddle is the best breakfast in town\n-The main casino bar is flanked by an amazing LED screen\n-Plastic bed lights up... VERY cool!\n\nCONS\n-Location: not near anything\n-I requested a non-down comforter three times over the course of two days and it never showed up.\n-Main casino bar is small and always mobbed and nowhere to sit.\n-Rooms are industrial-chic, and feel that way.  Cold, charmless.\n-The sink, bathroom and shower use sliding doors to access, a sloppy design.\n-The Griddle line is already insane (20 mins every morning minimum): once word gets out about this place, forget it.\n-Bar by reception closed at midnight. REALLY?\n-Pool scene is weak\n\nI cannot recommend this hotel and don't quite understand why anyone would want to stay here when there are so many better hotels on the strip for the same or lesser price.

She came up to the table to greet us by saying \""Are you ready to order\""  How about some drinks lady?  I can get by with horrible service if the food is good, but the food was lousy.\n\nWe ordered chicken lettuce cups, 2 different types of soup and 2 entrees.  They tried to bring the soup out first but I asked them if we could get our app first.  The chicken that came with the lettuce cups was just the fatty pieces of the chicken they don't used with the entree, but all minced up.  The texture was gross and the flavor was bland.  The soups were the only reason this review got 2 stars.  Pretty good.  Wife had wonton soup and I had seafood shelfish soup.  \n\nThe entrees sucked.  We shared Crispy Spicy Chicken which was more like Soggy Salty Chicken and the Orange Beef which was decent but soggy which made it not as good.

This place turned to crap.  I remember when it first opened I loved this place.  I thought it was the best Chinese Food in town.  Flo took so much pride into her recipes.  I am not sure what went wrong.\n\nI can't speak for all the servers there, but ours was terrible.  No personality just a freaking robot.  She came up to the table to greet us by saying \""Are you ready to order\""  How about some drinks lady?  I can get by with horrible service if the food is good, but the food was lousy.\n\nWe ordered chicken lettuce cups, 2 different types of soup and 2 entrees.  They tried to bring the soup out first but I asked them if we could get our app first.  The chicken that came with the lettuce cups was just the fatty pieces of the chicken they don't used with the entree, but all minced up.  The texture was gross and the flavor was bland.  The soups were the only reason this review got 2 stars.  Pretty good.  Wife had wonton soup and I had seafood shelfish soup.  \n\nThe entrees sucked.  We shared Crispy Spicy Chicken which was more like Soggy Salty Chicken and the Orange Beef which was decent but soggy which made it not as good.  The server never came by again therefore I went the whole meal without anything to drink.\n\nFor sure we will not be coming back anytime soon.  I am not sure why this place stays busy, it's not worth my time.  If I wasn't so hungry, I would have returned the entrees and app.

In fact, the garlic knots had no garlic, there was just some garlic sauce on the side and some marinara (tasted like crap). I think I had the worst pizza I've ever had in my life.

This place is absolutely horrible! 1 the service is just horrible, our waiter practically ignored us all night with our drinks empty and we had to ask her multiple times to get refills. 2 we ordered our food and it took forever to come out. I mean like 40 min with only 2 tables next to us and others dancing so that has absolutely no excuse for the kitchen to be taking so long to make our food. 3 when we try to pay our bill (which was only 38 dollars) I only had a 50 which is relatively close to the bill and our waiter said they didnt have change in the drawer, I mean its a 12 dollar change!!! What kind of a restraunt doesnt have 12 dollars change in the cash drawer?!?!? \n\nWell thats my experience of this place and it was absolutely fucking horrible. I wish I could put zero stars.

We finally got our beer from a gal but she said she can't take our order for food and we asked her to send over someone who can.  In fact, after waiting over 20 minutes after putting in our drink order, and still not having someone take our order, we had to pull a waitress from the other dining room to take our order and she was kind enough to do so.  She was already busy and seemed to be the only one actually being productive.   A short blonde waitress finally brought our wings finally after more than a half hour but didn't even give us time to ask for napkins and plates before running off only to spend about 10 minutes with who appeared to be her boyfriend and some friends a couple booths over.  We watched this short blonde waitress carry on with her boyfriend and she seemed to have a very foul attitude.  We assumed she was the \""intended\"" waitress for our table but evidentley not because a 4th waitress came to our table to check on us and she said she was our waitress apologetically because we were just finally meeting at the end of our meal.  We waited another unreasonabe amount of time for the check and a couple boxes for the leftover wings.  She finally came back with the check and a tiny box and said that was all she was allowed to give us for the dozen or so left over wings.  This box only held a few wings and we had 2 different flavors.  I told her how getting and adequate to go box has never been a problem in the past and insisted on speaking to the manager.  The manager \""Brooke\"" came to the table and I asked for an adequate box for our leftover wings and she said it's the rules not to give any more than the 1 tiny styrofoam box.  I could tell she wasn't the usual manager because she was dead set on passing the buck to the normal manager saying how they are even stricter with the rules than she is.  After I told her we are Tuesday regulars and she is clearly new to Tuesdays and lecturing her on how a good manager would handle things correctly without passing the buck and making the regular customer feel unimportant , she agreed to give us another tiny box.  But ONLY this time.  She really had no concern for the complaint about the bad service and in fact dismissed our concerns.

After I told her we are Tuesday regulars and she is clearly new to Tuesdays and lecturing her on how a good manager would handle things correctly without passing the buck and making the regular customer feel unimportant , she agreed to give us another tiny box.  But ONLY this time.  She really had no concern for the complaint about the bad service and in fact dismissed our concerns.  Tonight's experience was 100% a result of terrible management and may cost this restraunt a couple of good once a week regular patrons.  So if you happen to visit this place on a Tuesday and you have the misfortune of having the fill in Manager named Brooke, expect a similar experience and make sure you eat every wing your served at the table because they are too cheap to give an adequate to go box for the leftovers and they would rather the food just go to waste.

Holy Atomic Pile of Sh!t Batman!!!!\nThis stuff sucks.... Like the previous reviewer I got sucked in by the commercials. Plus they were the only ones open at 9:50PM for delivery.

Tasted like they put tons of salt on it. I was hoping that the additional green peppers, onioins, and mushroom would give it some flavor but I would not  have noticed they were there if I did not order it. The crust was all right but how do you screw up a thin-crust?

Blehhhh :/ this place shouldn't even be in business with how many decent sushi restaurants there are around town. Just don't even bother.\n\nFood is definitely subpar. Tiny tiny tiny pieces of fish on their nigiri, sushi rolls falling apart, hardly any roll options that weren't filled with \""freshened up\"" not so good fish drenched in spicy sauce.

While at Fiesta Mall with my son who was getting his hair cut we decided to eat. We wondered around the food court and was approached by an employee of Sarku Japan offering free samples of their teriaki chicken. After trying it my son just had to order from there.  The staff was friendly and the price was reasonable.  He ordered the teriaki chicken & shrimp. The amount of food that he got was way more than expected and he was happy it tasted like what it was suppose to. \nA definate place we'll visit in again and highly recommend!!

Could barely get a slice apart and when I did manage to cut it apart and picked up a slice, the cheese just slide right off into the pan. I ended up with a pile of cheese and the pizza wasn't tasty at all. My friend got a barbecue chicken pizza and it didn't taste like it as she used to get that at Red Brick just like I always got my Four Cheese. The Red Brick pizza was awesome and the cheese at least stayed on the slices. As much as I wanted to like this place since I hoped it was like the old Red Brick, this pizza wasn't any good. We won't be going back there.

Each time I've come here, there was a wait, but the staff were cranking out orders as fast as they possibly could (it's all made-to-order), so I've been happy with service. \n\nOn my most recent visit, I got the French Toast Bagel with cream cheese - my favorite breakfast served in a portable way?  Heck yeah!  The bagel was good, a great blend of cinnamon and maple syrup flavor.  A couple bites had a hint of onion though, as if it had rubbed up against the onion bagel.   Onions do not mesh well with french toast. \n\nI think their food prices are pretty fair, considering it's an airport location - but my bottle of OJ cost nearly as much as my bagel!   Still, a good choice when you need to grab something before your flight.

Not sure why we ate here but we were at NYNY because our girls wanted to ride the roller coaster.\n\nIn any case, we decided on Mexican and boy was that a mistake.  I ordered the fish tacos and the fish was really quite fowl tasting ~ not fresh at all.  Okay, so I moved onto the refried beans and rice ~ simply the worst ever ~ how hard is it to make rice and beans anyway???\n\nThe waitress noticed that I hardly touched my food and asked if she could bring me anything else.

I would liken it to the same price point as Applebee's but not even the same quality of taste.

One of the niceset sportsbooks on the strip. Large, comfy leather chairs, private area you can rent out with couches, etc. Plenty of windows and every line you could ever want. Staff helpful and friendly. One free drink coupon with a bet over $300. This seemed a little strange but hey when in vegas.
