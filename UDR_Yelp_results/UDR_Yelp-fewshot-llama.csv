We couldn't find many places that listed prices but ran across great reviews for the Qua Spa at Cesaer's on yelp and decided to make an appointment. It turns out that Qua is the spa and Color is the salon. We were a little disappointed because we wanted to see what Qua was like.\n\nWe were lead in and given mimosas. The place is very bright white and has a lot of marble. Allyn did my pedicure and was really nice and easy to talk to. The chairs have a great rolling massage option which was better than the typical vibrating chair massage. They also played fun top 40's which my roommate and I bopped along too as we joked around with our pedicurists. Allyn did slough off slightly too much skin because my toe had a tiny trickle of blood ( it's not her fault though, my feet are bone dry and prone to cracking, it also didn't hurt at all). Overall, it was a great experience. The only downside was the price- $100 for just a pedicure, but we figured we were on vacation in Vegas and just shrugged it off!

You will never have anyone come up to you to greet and to help you!  It's because, yes, they have what appears to be cool fish, but if you inquire, they'll sell you an illegal fish, too!  If I was able to give a zero star rating, I feel that would be a too generous of a rating for Trop-aquarium.  So let me expand on the facts I've experienced with this company.  First off Trop-Aquarium is the company that installed my 500 gallon fresh water tank which is built in a double sided wall.  The reason why we chose them was because they were less expensive than all the other quotes we received.  But in this case you really get what you pay for and less.  The reason for obtaining such a large fresh water tank was because I love large fish like big parrot fish and mainly an Arrowana.  We had 35 very large fish in the tank that we paid handsomely to Trop- Aquarium.  One Friday at noon 6 of our large fish died so because Trop- Aquarium maintained our tank, I texted, called and left a message immediately!  No response for a whole 3 days.  By now I'm frantically calling them because all 30 of my expensive fish had died.  Finally they pick up the phone and asked if I had over fed the fish, giggling and that they'll come in a day or two.  However meanwhile I, an unexperienced aquarium maintainer, was told that I need to remove all 30 dead corpses and to buy an airline with air rocks, 2 large buckets, tube everything properly, catch the remainder live fish, place them in the properly tubed buckets all at 12:36 am midnight.  They also offered if I don't know how to just leave the tank with only the dead fish removed, but I was sure all the live fish would've died by the time they came.  When they finally came days after, they realized that they had not glued down the returns.  So all the fish brutally suffocated before dieing.  The Trop-Aquarium technician cleaned the tank, drilled random visible holes in the Clear Vision tank to stick the airline pipe attached to the air rock that I had both purchased.  They verbally admitted to the installation error!  They then replaced our dead fish with 5 fish which were the size of a silver dollar.  Soon after their billing called us and said we owed them over $1000 for the work they did to fix the installation problem they created!  I contacted other aquarium builders and when they saw the tank, all six companies stated and agreed that no one ever would build a tank with no overflow mini tank and returns at the bottom.  Trop-Aquarium did this so that they would be the exclusive company to convert the tank, maintain it and also this way, they'd make a larger profit!  So, in conclusion, if you have limitless amount of money to burn,  want the cheapest specimen of fish in your fish tank, never want to get a timely response, and over all get scammed in the long run, Trop-Aquarium would be perfect for you!!!  Time is the true revealer of how a people are and how companies truly operate.

During my rough 5 year relationship with Trop- Aquarium, I come to realization that making $$$MONEY$$$ is their only priority and having a honest customer oriented business is NOT!!!!!  I WOULD NEVER WISH THIS EXPERIENCE UPON ANYONE ELSE!  You may have to pay a little more initially with another company, but in the long run over all, you will exceed a great amount of money you ever envisioned with Trop-Aquarium.

I did use them on my second order of fries which came a good 10-15 minutes later.  Iced tea came pretty regularly.

I've been going back and forth as to how many stars this place should get.  I finally decided on 2 because I can't award 1/2 a star and feel 3 stars is too many.\n\nMy friends and I visited on a Saturday afternoon.  We entered and asked if we could sit in the bar area but we wouldn't be able to sit at the bar because there were too many of us.  The hostess was very short and said she would get something for us and be right back, then, she disappeared.  When she came back she led us to the furthest table from the bar.  Not what we wanted or asked for.  We decided we were going to ask for a table at the bar and was informed that outside was open seating- this would've helped when we asked the first time but, whatever.\n\nOur server was not the sunniest bulb in the box, meaning, she was not friendly.  Gosh, I hate that and it put me in a bad mood.  Last time I checked, she was there to help us at her own will, not against it.  Geesh.  We all had a couple drinks and some of us had appetizers.  They were good but nothing to write home about.  Bar food.\n\nMy favorite part of the evening was when my friends rode the bull.  It was entertaining.\n\nSo, in closing, go to ride the bull and then get the hell out of there.  Well, maybe stop at the bar and grab a drink first.

Worst customer service ever back in mid-January.  I'm a pretty chill, easy-going dude, but by the end of this visit I wanted to put every McD worker in a Ric Flair figure-four leglock. \n\nCashier was terrible.  Middle-aged dude looked like he was hating life (no comment here) and didn't greet patrons with anything more than a lazy nod.  He had to have been thinking, \""What the hell do you want?\""  A simple \""Hey, what can I get for you?\"" would have sufficed.\n\nI'm an optimist, but my orange juice was half-empty.  I hemmed and hawed about pointing it out, but did so.  Chick on duty returned with my juice filled with ice.  Really?  You don't think I can tell that its ice and not juice?  Later, chick said that the orange juice was not ready yet.  Might I suggest a solution?  GET IT READY - ICE IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE.\n\nBacon, Cheese & Egg Biscuit with no bacon, please.  It took them TWENTY minutes, FOUR different McD workers, and THREE breakfast sandwiches to get my friend's order right.  Not that difficult of an order - it doesn't mean a Sausage McMuffin without sausage; it doesn't mean a Bacon, Cheese & Egg Biscuit with egg; and it definitely doesn't mean a Sausage McMuffin without sausage, even the second time around.  \n\nDuring the BCE Biscuit incident, they still never gave me my coffee.  I politely informed the cashier, and the dude tells me he didn't forget it.  Let me guess, coffee beans aren't harvested yet and there wasn't even ice to try and trick me.  He then proceeded to pour me a cup.\n\nWhat a Mickey Mouse operation.  I will not come to this location again.\n\ndmo out.

Haha! \n\nI was \""tasked\"" (ugh) to pick up supplies for our pumpkin contest at work. We had a \""theme\"" (kinda)...but no clue of how to make that happen. Thank goodness the staff was helpful!

Narrow table would have been good to allow cross-table conversation too. A few smiles and waves were given!\n\nIt was a nice venue, good view of the castle, but the food wasn't just forgettable - it was disappointing and felt like a waste of my money.

These were awesome.  everything tasted fresh and great.  Nice portion for everyone at our table\n\nSalad Course was good, tomatoes, garbanzo beans, peppers, manchego \n\nKing Crab Risotto -  This dish was very rich and very tasty.  the risotto was perfectly cooked.\n\nOur entrees consisted of \nDover Sole - my guests who ordered this said it was OK and wished they got something else.  It was not prepared properly\n\nFilet and Lobster tail -  the filet was perfectly cooked as were the lobster tales but the tales were tiny.  I mean baby lobster tiny.

We had our wedding reception at lakeside grill for 50 people in the vista room.   Christina Telese was my contact for the event, and she was nothing short of fantastic.  She really helped me get everything together and I could not have done it without her.  \n\nWe chose this location based on a couple of things.  \n1.  SW would not accommodate a party our size \n2. We have eaten here before and liked the food, although the service left something to be desired\n3. It's a beautiful space in a beautiful hotel\n \nThe menu we chose was their priciest at $150.00 pp.  Mostly everything was great but there were some misses.  Our menu consisted of... \n\n*Antipasto including iberico ham, manchego cheese, marinated olives & bread -  this was a hit.  everything was delicious\n\n*Black Truffle Arancini -  Delicious and they went fast\n\n*Whipped garlic feta cheese with mushrooms and bread - Could have skipped it\n\nShellfish Platters - made up of the largest shrimp I have ever seen, lobster tails, oysters and Alaskan king crab legs.  These were awesome.  everything tasted fresh and great.  Nice portion for everyone at our table\n\nSalad Course was good, tomatoes, garbanzo beans, peppers, manchego \n\nKing Crab Risotto -  This dish was very rich and very tasty.  the risotto was perfectly cooked.\n\nOur entrees consisted of \nDover Sole - my guests who ordered this said it was OK and wished they got something else.  It was not prepared properly\n\nFilet and Lobster tail -  the filet was perfectly cooked as were the lobster tales but the tales were tiny.  I mean baby lobster tiny.  Still very good though. \n\nBone in NY Strip - The steak itself was very good, however, our guests did not get a choice on temperature.  So most were very rare.  I know that this is typical for most large parties but still.. \n\nFor dessert we had an assortment brought to each table.  Nothing was really a stand out unfortunately.  \n\nThe service for the most part was great, the beginning of the meal felt very rushed to me.  I'm not sure anyone else noticed but overall it was a fantastic meal.  I will definitely return.

No wonder a lot of the terrible Glamour Shots poses from the 90's had people looking absolutely terrified.\n\nThe makeup is not tailored to each person.  They used the same neutral palette on both of us, and it's a normal 4 shades of brown application that one would do for a smoky eye.  When asked what we wanted for hair, I'm not sure what my friend said, but I know I said I was looking for a pin up, vintage style.  It was a side part with curls.  That's it.

It's the world's most complete animal protein.  Bodybuilders and Meatheads alike know...if you want more muscle, you must eat more protein!  I'm far from my early 20's when I used to add a raw egg or 2 to my daily whey protein & creatine shake, or eat 6 hard boiled eggs daily to help 'bulk up'...but I still love me some eggs early in the morning!\n\nThe Cracked Egg if you can't already tell is a breakfast-heavy joint.  They are usually only open daily for breakfast and lunch.  It's been voted 'The Best of Las Vegas' by the LVRJ at least 3 times.  So I figure instead of making my own breakfast we'd go check this place out.  \n\nThe day we went it was packed!  Of course, it was a Sunday and church was probably just letting out.  There's a big hustle and bustle here, no shortage of orders being called out, waitstaff running around with plates, and the smell of fresh coffee being brewed.  Man, do I love the first meal of the day!  Yes, I am a morning person.  Night owls beware!\n\nMenu is a good size and offers a ton of choices.  Now with The Cracked Egg being its namesake, please realize that most of their dishes require EGGS.  If you don't like eggs or egg products STEER CLEAR.  Should be obvious.  Go back to your overpriced lattes and friggin' scones.  Go dunk your donuts somewhere else.  Go back to your toaster to watch those tarts pop.  I feel sad for you folks.\n\nThe Cracked Egg has different parts to their menu.  There's \""Breanne's Basics\"" which  have your plain eggs & bacon, eggs & sausage, and similar type stuff here.  In \""Eggs With Attitude\"" these dishes are mostly various things scrambled with eggs, which they call a 'scramble'.  I much enjoy the Southwest Scramble which has 3 eggs scrambled with chorizo, green chiles, jalapenos, onion, jack & cheddar cheese, and a side of salsa.  \""The Benedicts\"" is self-explanatory, a list of all their different Eggs Benedict concoctions.  Me?  I like the good ol' regular Eggs Benedict standard, done right.  In the \""Fluffy & Folded\"" section you got your 3 egg omelettes, and my faves are The Denver with ham, bell peppers, onions, and cheese, or The Greek with spinach, tomatoes, and feta.  Yum!  \""Sin City Skillets\"" are for you wannabe cowboys who like your food coming in a cast-iron skillet, build your own or choose one off of their menu.  The last big breakfast section is \""From the Griddle\"" and includes their French toast choices as well as fresh pancakes.  From what I've tried and what I've heard...it's all pretty good stuff.  \n\nThe Cracked Egg also has non-breakfast stuff for you non-breakfast eaters too.  From sandwiches and salads, to burgers and homemade chili, it's all there.  But why come to a breakfast joint and not have breakfast?  It's like going to El Pollo Loco and asking for fish!  Try the breakfast.\n\nOnly gripe I have here is that the prices are a bit on the high side.  I could make some of these dishes at home easily for half the cost, and do just as good a job since I love making breakfast anyway.  Two folks eating breakfast with a cup of joe each will probably set you back $25+ after tax and tip depending on what you eat.  Worth it if you go every once in a while or on a special occasion.  Or if you're loaded like Steve Wynn.

Man, do I love the first meal of the day!  Yes, I am a morning person.  Night owls beware!\n\nMenu is a good size and offers a ton of choices.  Now with The Cracked Egg being its namesake, please realize that most of their dishes require EGGS.  If you don't like eggs or egg products STEER CLEAR.  Should be obvious.  Go back to your overpriced lattes and friggin' scones.  Go dunk your donuts somewhere else.  Go back to your toaster to watch those tarts pop.  I feel sad for you folks.\n\nThe Cracked Egg has different parts to their menu.  There's \""Breanne's Basics\"" which  have your plain eggs & bacon, eggs & sausage, and similar type stuff here.  In \""Eggs With Attitude\"" these dishes are mostly various things scrambled with eggs, which they call a 'scramble'.  I much enjoy the Southwest Scramble which has 3 eggs scrambled with chorizo, green chiles, jalapenos, onion, jack & cheddar cheese, and a side of salsa.  \""The Benedicts\"" is self-explanatory, a list of all their different Eggs Benedict concoctions.  Me?  I like the good ol' regular Eggs Benedict standard, done right.  In the \""Fluffy & Folded\"" section you got your 3 egg omelettes, and my faves are The Denver with ham, bell peppers, onions, and cheese, or The Greek with spinach, tomatoes, and feta.  Yum!  \""Sin City Skillets\"" are for you wannabe cowboys who like your food coming in a cast-iron skillet, build your own or choose one off of their menu.  The last big breakfast section is \""From the Griddle\"" and includes their French toast choices as well as fresh pancakes.  From what I've tried and what I've heard...it's all pretty good stuff.  \n\nThe Cracked Egg also has non-breakfast stuff for you non-breakfast eaters too.  From sandwiches and salads, to burgers and homemade chili, it's all there.  But why come to a breakfast joint and not have breakfast?  It's like going to El Pollo Loco and asking for fish!  Try the breakfast.\n\nOnly gripe I have here is that the prices are a bit on the high side.  I could make some of these dishes at home easily for half the cost, and do just as good a job since I love making breakfast anyway.  Two folks eating breakfast with a cup of joe each will probably set you back $25+ after tax and tip depending on what you eat.  Worth it if you go every once in a while or on a special occasion.  Or if you're loaded like Steve Wynn.  Geez, that guy is rich.\n\nStop by The Cracked Egg, have a hearty breakfast, then bench press that little Fiat in the parking lot!

Not really the place for me, went with a large group and felt claustrophobic in there.  Very dark and kind of boring with one descent tv.

This place is LITERALLY on top of a nightclub. If you like feeling at 1:52am that you're in the middle of a party scene while laying in bed than this may be the place for you. Unfortunately for me I like to sleep. I will never stay here again.

I wanted to redo all of the windows in my house and their designer Jan came to help me decide what to get.\n\nJan was rude, condescending and just snarky. I had to chase her back to her car, because I wasn't done. I really wanted the window coverings or would have given up. I decided to get shutters for the whole house, placed the order and put down the deposit.\n\nSeveral days later the installers called to schedule the measuring. I was driving so asked if they could call back in an hour or two when I was home. \n\nAfter we hung up I got another phone call, and when I answered it turned out one of the installers had butt-dialed me back by accident and I could hear them talking about me. Jan had told them seriously horrible things about me (we were together for like one hour with my then 18-month-old son at home) and I could hear them discussing it. Seriously? What could have happened in an hour with a lone woman and a young toddler? Jan was obviously uninterested in me as a customer, judgemental and the worse salesperson ever. The installers were saying how mean I was and I was mad because they called while I was driving. Really? What I said almost word for word was, \""I'm driving now and can't access my calendar which is on my computer at home. Can you call me back in an hour or two?\"".\n\nI was so mad I called the owner and cancelled my order and got my $3000 deposit back. Luckily I had paid by credit card so they had no choice but to give me my money back. \n\nFast forward to now, three years later.

House of Window Coverings has the most unprofessional and unhelpful employees ever. I wanted to redo all of the windows in my house and their designer Jan came to help me decide what to get.\n\nJan was rude, condescending and just snarky. I had to chase her back to her car, because I wasn't done. I really wanted the window coverings or would have given up. I decided to get shutters for the whole house, placed the order and put down the deposit.\n\nSeveral days later the installers called to schedule the measuring. I was driving so asked if they could call back in an hour or two when I was home. \n\nAfter we hung up I got another phone call, and when I answered it turned out one of the installers had butt-dialed me back by accident and I could hear them talking about me. Jan had told them seriously horrible things about me (we were together for like one hour with my then 18-month-old son at home) and I could hear them discussing it. Seriously? What could have happened in an hour with a lone woman and a young toddler? Jan was obviously uninterested in me as a customer, judgemental and the worse salesperson ever. The installers were saying how mean I was and I was mad because they called while I was driving. Really? What I said almost word for word was, \""I'm driving now and can't access my calendar which is on my computer at home. Can you call me back in an hour or two?\"".\n\nI was so mad I called the owner and cancelled my order and got my $3000 deposit back. Luckily I had paid by credit card so they had no choice but to give me my money back. \n\nFast forward to now, three years later. As of 1 month ago I still hadn't gotten the shutters I wanted because I was so irritated by the previous experience. But a month ago I finally bit the bullet and called Sunburst. What a refreshing change. The guys they sent out were nice and helpful. If they had any negative thoughts about me and my family they kept it professionally to themselves.

The other waiter came thru and said do you want to start tomorrow jokingly :) and then said she didn't come over yet??? and I said no.  So I go back to my table.  I then see the waitress at the computer assuming maybe she is preparing my check.  Wait. wait. wait.  Others at the table are getting annoyed too.  So I take my two pancakes on a plate up to the waitress.  I said I would like a box and my check please.  She is lost in a fog.  I said please get me a box and my check.  Again lost in fog.  I hand the plate to her and said I will meet you up front at the register.  I tipped her too and I really don't know why.  Should it take 2 hours to eat in an empty restuarant?

So nice to see the new I-Hop location at Cotswald and I had the opportunity to visit last weekend with two other adults a newborn and 6 year old.  The waitress was super sweet.  Our order and meal went well and the food was tastey.  However I waited forever for my check.  I asked another server to let my waitress know I needed my check  but saw she had been seated a second table.  So I waited.  Then I got up and went to the kitchen door.  The other waiter came thru and said do you want to start tomorrow jokingly :) and then said she didn't come over yet??? and I said no.  So I go back to my table.  I then see the waitress at the computer assuming maybe she is preparing my check.  Wait. wait. wait.  Others at the table are getting annoyed too.  So I take my two pancakes on a plate up to the waitress.  I said I would like a box and my check please.  She is lost in a fog.  I said please get me a box and my check.  Again lost in fog.  I hand the plate to her and said I will meet you up front at the register.  I tipped her too and I really don't know why.  Should it take 2 hours to eat in an empty restuarant?   What I really meant to say was are you supposed to wait for an hour after you eat to get the check??

I was visiting AZ last weekend, friends suggested I go here since its a new place in old town. Got there around 8.30 and after 25 mins of looking for table we found one. It took another 20 for someone to take our order (we ordered food & drinks). As we waited for our food  the rude bouncers came and asked us to get up and move to the next table, we did, then a few minutes later, they told us they needed the chairs we were sitting on, and they took those as well.

Lets just say i am a very easy going & understanding person & it takes a lot to annoy me. Probably one of the worst experiences I have had at a place like this. I was visiting AZ last weekend, friends suggested I go here since its a new place in old town. Got there around 8.30 and after 25 mins of looking for table we found one. It took another 20 for someone to take our order (we ordered food & drinks). As we waited for our food  the rude bouncers came and asked us to get up and move to the next table, we did, then a few minutes later, they told us they needed the chairs we were sitting on, and they took those as well.

This process will include working out the deal over the phone....The below story can be summed up with Airpark's final statement to me as \""...if you do not finance through us we don't want your business and we want you to leave\""\n\nIn any case,  Airpark Dodge made this the most adversarial car purchasing experience I have ever had.  They are, in my opinion, the most extremely aggressive, misleading, non-scrupulous and untrustworthy dealership I have ever run across.  They wasted a full day of my time and I suggest, prior to going, you tread lightly and consider about anyplace else.\n\n***********************\nDuring the entire 24 hour process (to the hour) we were extremely clear we had our own financing with an extremely good rate (one they would either not beat or could barely match). In any case we clearly stated we are simply there to purchase the vehicle only and for the amount we required.  It was very clear nothing less than these statements would be acceptable and we wanted a quick and easy transaction.\n\nWe started the day with the requirements stated and accepted over the phone.  All we needed was the purchase agreement from them. And we would be on our way to the bank to pick up the check and make our purchase.\n\nWithout going into the line by line issues I will simply state a full day of \""misunderstandings\"" on totals, rebates, sums, flaws and missteps occurred.  They continuously sent incorrect data to give to the bank.  Not only incorrect data but incorrect paperwork.  It was extremely clear as to what we were looking for.  I find it very hard to believe they have never dealt with a customer in this manner.\n\nIt became obvious I would have to go and get it from them physically (which ends out being exactly what they wanted). Upon arrival the salesman attempted to have me sign all their standard applications for credit (of which I, again, clearly stated I wanted no part of).  In fact at one point he attempted to convince me it was for the purchase only that he required this information (this included my ssn)....

I really wish Yelp would allow zero stars.\n\n\nSince Airpark Dodge is local We figured it would be a great place to go purchase our exact specification of a Jeep Grand Cherokee for exactly the cost we investigated as fair.\n\nWe attempted to make this purchase at Airpark Dodge using our own funding.  This process will include working out the deal over the phone....The below story can be summed up with Airpark's final statement to me as \""...if you do not finance through us we don't want your business and we want you to leave\""\n\nIn any case,  Airpark Dodge made this the most adversarial car purchasing experience I have ever had.  They are, in my opinion, the most extremely aggressive, misleading, non-scrupulous and untrustworthy dealership I have ever run across.  They wasted a full day of my time and I suggest, prior to going, you tread lightly and consider about anyplace else.\n\n***********************\nDuring the entire 24 hour process (to the hour) we were extremely clear we had our own financing with an extremely good rate (one they would either not beat or could barely match). In any case we clearly stated we are simply there to purchase the vehicle only and for the amount we required.  It was very clear nothing less than these statements would be acceptable and we wanted a quick and easy transaction.\n\nWe started the day with the requirements stated and accepted over the phone.  All we needed was the purchase agreement from them. And we would be on our way to the bank to pick up the check and make our purchase.\n\nWithout going into the line by line issues I will simply state a full day of \""misunderstandings\"" on totals, rebates, sums, flaws and missteps occurred.  They continuously sent incorrect data to give to the bank.  Not only incorrect data but incorrect paperwork.  It was extremely clear as to what we were looking for.  I find it very hard to believe they have never dealt with a customer in this manner.\n\nIt became obvious I would have to go and get it from them physically (which ends out being exactly what they wanted). Upon arrival the salesman attempted to have me sign all their standard applications for credit (of which I, again, clearly stated I wanted no part of).  In fact at one point he attempted to convince me it was for the purchase only that he required this information (this included my ssn).... I may be dense but not that dense and I clarified my position by statingif I gave you my ssn you do not have permission to run my credit.... Funny, he no longer cared to get that filled out and ran off to see his manager (and I had no intention of giving this to him anyhow)\n\nThe finance manager got into the mix, actually had the nerve to ask me to explain what the problem was.

He had just stayed 5 nights in the Penthouse Suite at The Mirage, so while the room was quite different than we were used to, it was very clean, comfortable, and quite large for a typical hotel room. We paid $59/night for a Fri-Sat stay, which is far less than you could get for a similar room on the Strip. \n\nThe room was very nicely decorated in Earth tones. Our room had a very comfortable king sized bed, two night stands, a love seat in a small sitting area, dining table, and a television armoire. They haven't yet upgraded to flat screen televisions in the Deluxe King rooms, but we didn't spend any time in the room watching television anyway. There is a safe located inside the television armoire, which is very small, but suitable for cameras and small electronic equipment. \nAir conditioning worked very well, although the unit itself was somewhat noisy. This actually turned out to be a plus, as the night we arrived they were having a Zumba dance party by the pool, and listening to the air conditioner was more pleasant than the horrid music pumping out during the marathon exercise session\n. \nThe bathroom is small, but perfectly adequate. The biggest complaint was that the shower head was too low for my 6'3\"" sweetie. Otherwise, the bathroom was stocked with plenty of towels along with Bath and Body Works products. Hot water was plentiful and the water pressure was great.\n\nThe casino itself is awesome. Very large, plenty of slot machines and table games are available. The Silverton Rewards club provides great benefits, and we both received a pass to Seasons Buffet once we earned 50 points on the Rewards Card (which took all of about 20 minutes to earn). We are both non-smokers, and neither of us had any complaints about excessive smoke in the casino. In fact, the only time I ever noticed smoke was if a smoker sat down next to me. Wait staff in the casino was FAR superior to any of the casinos we played at on the Strip.\n\nThe restaurants at Silverton are fabulous. We ate at nearly every single restaurant on property and enjoyed them all. I wouldn't say that Seasons was the greatest buffet in the world, but it was clean, food was well stocked, and our waiter was right on top of everything. Mi Casa Cantina serves up excellent Mexican food at a very reasonable price. The Sundance Grill is open 24 hours and provides casual dining with late night food specials. We ate breakfast here; it was tasty and very budget friendly. Johnny Rockets is also located on the casino floor, but we did not eat here on this trip. The flagship of the Silverton dining experience is Twin Creeks- which is an absolute must-visit during your trip. It has a beautifully romantic ambiance, and serves upscale steakhouse fare at prices much lower than similar restaurants on the Strip. The Tomahawk Rib Eye was simply divine! I just can't say enough about this incredible restaurant and the amazing staff.\nThe Silverton is connected to a Bass Pro Shop. If you are into that kind of thing, this store is huge and gorgeous. We went in and walked around, but didn't buy anything. Neither one of us are into outdoor sports, so I can't comment on whether or not the place is overpriced.\n\nThe best thing about the Silverton is the overall atmosphere and service level. The staff members were all very accommodating, helpful, and extremely friendly. We didn't have a bad experience with a single staff member on property, and we went everywhere. Upon our arrival at around 11am, we had practically no wait for service, and the front desk clerk had no problem giving us an early check in time. All the housekeeping staff made sure to say hello anytime they walked by, and all of the wait staff members in the restaurants were attentive and friendly. The casino caters to a slightly older clientele with some locals, and since there isn't a nightclub on property, there is very little pretentiousness among the guests. Everyone we ran into was relaxed and polite. And then there is the convenience factor; everything at the hotel/casino is within a 5 minute walk from your room, and the hotel is all of 10 minutes away from the Strip.

The Mirage was seemingly unaware of how girls weekends operate.  Their attitude was uncaring and I will NEVER go back.  Why make a reservation for two rooms in advance if the reservation itself is not honored?  Why pay a reservation hold fee if it isn't holding what you want?  Why go out of town for a girls weekend, if you can't spend the weekend with the girls?  We did have fun, but the inconvenience was a bit dampening.  If you expect good customer service go to the Bellagio, if you want clean rooms and no service, then stay here.

I don't know why you would go here. There's nothing here that you can't find at the Albertson's in the same shopping center, and they charge twice the price. I seriously saw a box of cereal on sale for $8.49. Skip the hell out of this place.

I'm sorry to crap on this place, but when I lived down the road I stopped in here once and refused to go back. I assumed by the looks of it and what I heard from friends that most items were cheaper than giant eagle, but I found quite the opposite. The selection wasn't good, the actual building is pretty run down, and the prices of most items were actually higher than other grocery stores in the area. I'd recommend stopping over at giant eagle or Aldi instead.

That said, it's a fully loaded convenience store/gas station. ATM, ice, beer, etc.

Still a fan here!  Shop Cardenas weekly to get dinner goods for Taco Night at our house!  This place is close to my work so I'm here at least twice a week for cheap produce and reasonably priced meats.  The selection is still great, and I've noticed over the months that more and more non-Latinos shop here!  Good job people!  Cheapy like me!  Their produce prices sure beat the local Albertson's and Vons and Smith's by a long shot.  The only other place I get veggies is the Asian market but that's only because those yummy types of veggies aren't found here at Cardenas.  Go ahead, ask the stocker where they keep the baby bok choy and the fragrant pears!  You will get a look of confusion.

WRONG!  \n\nThen we had to wait around for the check and for him to run my card.  It was funny, but I was looking around and spotted the servers other tables.

I tried Toast for the first time this past weekend and would definitely recommend it.  I came in for brunch with a friend, and yes, there was about a 15 minute wait, but they served us coffee in the meantime.  And they offer you corn bread and apple butter as soon as you're seated - a great start. It's a much bigger space than I expected, and they really efficiently take care of everyone with the team service.  Even though some other reviews have noted that you don't get to develop a relationship with the servers,  they were all incredibly friendly and helpful so it really didn't matter to me.  We got omelettes and a side of french toast and everything was great.  It was exactly what we wanted and served incredibly quickly but without rushing us.  I'll definitely be back.

The only good thing about this bar is that you can usually see an athlete or two every weekend night.\n\nThe bad: obnoxious underage coasties, over crowded, dirty, crappy music, douche bags, jersey chasers, and the staff sucks.\n\nThere is never a good reason to go to this place.

My father was an odd man, a brutal man, a man with big dreams and small child like hands.  On my fifth birthday he brought Rex with him as he knocked over a 7-11.  As Rex helped him tie up the store clerk he let me pick any one thing Rex wanted in the store.  Young Rex wandered around the store, trying very hard to not step in the pools of blood, Rex saw the object he wanted...Rex turned and said \""Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora can Rex have THAT?\""  He nodded.  Rex kicked the 87 year old man laying on some of it...and picked it up. It was a bag with a delicious cheesesteak in it.  Rex danced. Rex smiled. Rex took the wallet of a crying soccer dad.  Rex was happy.  Rex and Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora drove down the street, the sound of sirens in the distance fading...the smell of the cheesesteak wafting into Rex's young nasal passages.  A great cheesesteak is a gift from above.  A wallet filled with 20 dollar bills and an unused condom...icing on the cake.  After we divided the ill gotten booty, Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora always took 70% (until I turned 9...but that is another story)...Rex ate his cheesesteak.  Perfect bread. Juicy shredded meat. Perfectly cooked onions. The right amount of whiz. Juice ran down Rex's chin. Juice ran down Rex's hands. Rex shook in delight. That memory, and the 8 months Rex spent on the run after Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora ratted him out...will always be with him.\n\nPops Philly Cheesesteak is not only an insult to that memory it is an insult to all things with meat, cheese, bread or even hot foods.  The front page of the their website has a picture of their pitiful attempt of a cheeesteak...one of one of their abominations has green pepper on it. GREEN PEPPER!!  Let me explain something to all of you who are not from Philly...IF there was a place in Philadelphia that put green bell peppers on their cheeseteak...THE CITIZENS WOULD BURN IT DOWN!!!

It isn't bad, but again it isn't East Coast good.  Cheese...never enough. Never. If you get provolone instead of whiz it is almost non-existent. Shame on you for skimping on the cheese.  The Whiz isn't bad sometimes but more often than not there isn't enough.  The meat isn't bad. It is done well, with one BIG problem...it is often dry. Not enough oil or cooked and then recooked, whatever the reason it is not great.  If you get to Pops on the right day and get lucky, and order correctly, it isn't bad...but the overall consistency is not there.\n\nLastly...the \""Philly\"" part of the menu...the Tastycakes, the birch beer, the rest of it...all WAY TOO EXPENSIVE!

Not so much anymore, you made me happy IHOP with finally opening your doors a few years back here in the region.\n\nAs for the most recent visit to your lovely location outside of Greenfield/Squirrel Hill, there were many ups, and a few downs.  \n\nI was going to do the ups first and then do the downs, but they kind of mix together so I'm just gonna go through it all at once.\n\nCongrats on finally being open 24 hours!  Not so big congrats to advertise it.  I didn't notice it on the sign if you were open 24 hours, and the parking lot looks shady when you pull up and see no cars in the lot and you have to do a parking lot circle to make sure.  The lettering you use on the door is quite small too.  Even with my glasses, I was still squinting to see if you were open.  As soon as I saw '24' on the door, the car went into park and I was heading for the door.\n\nAs late as it was at night, my friend and I were the only two people besides the workers in the building.  Big plus for us, no wait.  Service was super fast if you couldn't have guessed.\n\nHere's something I learned as well, the menu changes at 10 p.m.  Not a big deal for me as I was getting pancakes, as it is the International House of Pancakes.  As for my friend, she was really hoping to get the garden crepes.  So when the server came our way to take the order she went back to ask the cook if she wouldn't mind making it for her and the answer was something along the lines of 'Sure, I'll make it.'  Big props for making these two customers feel happy about that.

You know, I used to have this out of town romance that left a sweetness in my mouth.  The only way I could get a fix was if I left Pittsburgh behind me and headed for warmer climates.  Not so much anymore, you made me happy IHOP with finally opening your doors a few years back here in the region.\n\nAs for the most recent visit to your lovely location outside of Greenfield/Squirrel Hill, there were many ups, and a few downs.  \n\nI was going to do the ups first and then do the downs, but they kind of mix together so I'm just gonna go through it all at once.\n\nCongrats on finally being open 24 hours!  Not so big congrats to advertise it.  I didn't notice it on the sign if you were open 24 hours, and the parking lot looks shady when you pull up and see no cars in the lot and you have to do a parking lot circle to make sure.  The lettering you use on the door is quite small too.  Even with my glasses, I was still squinting to see if you were open.  As soon as I saw '24' on the door, the car went into park and I was heading for the door.\n\nAs late as it was at night, my friend and I were the only two people besides the workers in the building.  Big plus for us, no wait.  Service was super fast if you couldn't have guessed.\n\nHere's something I learned as well, the menu changes at 10 p.m.  Not a big deal for me as I was getting pancakes, as it is the International House of Pancakes.  As for my friend, she was really hoping to get the garden crepes.  So when the server came our way to take the order she went back to ask the cook if she wouldn't mind making it for her and the answer was something along the lines of 'Sure, I'll make it.'  Big props for making these two customers feel happy about that.

This has to be the worst massages my wife & I have received in our lives.\n\nMy wife and I have been getting massages all around the world including Thailand for 20 years.\n\nWe call and get 1.5 hour appointments at 8:30pm.  (1 hour body & 1/2 hour foot massage) We arrive at 8:32 and start filling out forms.  My wife's 1st question SPECIFICALLY asks for a strong therapist.  The receptionist says yes, there is a strong therapist.  My wife's 2nd question was if the therapist was Thai; the receptionist says no, they are Chinese...BUT they've been trained by a Thai therapist.  I have nothing against Chinese therapists (I am Chinese) when I am getting a Chinese massage.  The techniques are worlds apart.  The receptionist continues to say it's OK, many customers ask for these therapists, they are good, etc...\n\nSo we make the wrong choice and continue.\n\nWe change into their shirt and pants and lie down on the mat.  My massage starts with a foot rub and pressing on my legs.  Not much of a massage just kind of squeezing on my muscles.  Continued onto the rest of my legs.  After that she started to pull and bend my legs.  Not much pressure was being applied so I'm not sure what this \""exercise\"" was about.  Not much changed for the duration of the 1 hour.  A lot of of just lightly rubbing and petting like other Yelpers mentioned.  Rubbed my scalp, my ears, my back, my neck and my arms a few times.  Pulled on my fingers...THIS WAS NOT A MASSAGE.\nNow onto the last 1/2 hour, the foot massage.  The therapists actually switched at this point!  I didn't know what's going on until later.

He said, \""Okay well what do you want?\""  I ordered the chorizo pizza again to which he said, \""Oh I care about the safety of my customers.  There was an issue with food poisoning at Firefly.  Did you hear about that.\""  I nodded dumbfounded.\n\n\""Ever since that has happened I quit.  I have substituted it with sausage.  You will like it.\""  He said.  I wanted to call BS because the Firefly incident had happened in May or late April.  I had been to this spot twice in less than a month and they had it, but at this point why argue.  I was just happy to have my order taken.  I rolled my eyes a bit and noticed a zombie arm was gone on the wall from the decor.    Where it had been was a grey patch and holes where the nails had once been.  (Mind you this is a black background.)  How hard is it to get a ladder, slap some black paint on a spot, and make the focal point of your bar look somewhat okay?\n\nWe got our food but as before our drinks were empty.  When we asked the lady that delivered our food about our drinks she said, \""I think Jazz is working on that,\"" and disappeared back in the kitchen.  My husband tried to get drinks.  Jazz said he was busy and we would have to wait, as he had the hose in his hand. (We ordered waters and diet cokes.)  I give up this place has the worst service, music, and now what was good pizza is average. This place is a joke, don't go.

Nice little cottage with a kitchen (where they have a few tables next to the chef), a dining area, and an outside patio area. There are lots of candles and can be romantic place. The waiters were all nice, but we had some issues with the service. A group of 4 that came 20mins later than us(just 2) sat next to our table and kept getting food quicker than us. The most annoying part was that the waiters kept telling us our food would come, but the speed and service was definitely lacking. \n\nAs for the food, it was definitely worth 3+ stars except for the main chicken pesto dish.

The dessert was just some strawberries and fudge brownie. Again, nothing special.\n\nAll in all, I did like the experience, but the food left me thinking there could have been more or that it could have been better.

They've installed a good ventilation system.\n\nI'll always have fond thoughts about the Strat even though I'm not there very often.  It was here when I was invited to a free slot tournament that through some twist of fate, I came in first and won the grand prize of $10,000.  That still doesn't buy the place an extra star but it brings warm fuzzy thoughts!

The selection of roles was quite large and all of them were very tasty. I strongly recommend this place to anyone who is a sushi lover, I'd give it a 6 out of 5 stars.

The sauce was ok.  \nNext time I'm looking for Thai Curry near work, I'll search for somewhere else.

Went here on a recommendation from someone who clearly has never had the kind of Thai food that's so good you may lay down in the road for it.  The food was mediocre, the waiter looked like he was angry and wanted us to die.  The only thing worth mentioning were the potato pockets.  Those were pretty good, but not enough to consider going back.

0,"My husband and I usually come in on Tuesdays for the .35 wing special. The service is always bad but we usually overlook it as there are few places to eat in San Tan Valley and we kind of like the wings.  Tonight's experience especially unsatisfactory.   Disappointment all around.  Still not sure on who was supposed to be our actual waitress.  We waited a very unreasonable amount of time to get our drinks and have our order taken.  We finally got our beer from a gal but she said she can't take our order for food and we asked her to send over someone who can.  In fact, after waiting over 20 minutes after putting in our drink order, and still not having someone take our order, we had to pull a waitress from the other dining room to take our order and she was kind enough to do so.  She was already busy and seemed to be the only one actually being productive.   A short blonde waitress finally brought our wings finally after more than a half hour but didn't even give us time to ask for napkins and plates before running off only to spend about 10 minutes with who appeared to be her boyfriend and some friends a couple booths over.  We watched this short blonde waitress carry on with her boyfriend and she seemed to have a very foul attitude.  We assumed she was the \""intended\"" waitress for our table but evidentley not because a 4th waitress came to our table to check on us and she said she was our waitress apologetically because we were just finally meeting at the end of our meal.  We waited another unreasonabe amount of time for the check and a couple boxes for the leftover wings.  She finally came back with the check and a tiny box and said that was all she was allowed to give us for the dozen or so left over wings.  This box only held a few wings and we had 2 different flavors.  I told her how getting and adequate to go box has never been a problem in the past and insisted on speaking to the manager.  The manager \""Brooke\"" came to the table and I asked for an adequate box for our leftover wings and she said it's the rules not to give any more than the 1 tiny styrofoam box.  I could tell she wasn't the usual manager because she was dead set on passing the buck to the normal manager saying how they are even stricter with the rules than she is.  After I told her we are Tuesday regulars and she is clearly new to Tuesdays and lecturing her on how a good manager would handle things correctly without passing the buck and making the regular customer feel unimportant , she agreed to give us another tiny box.  But ONLY this time.  She really had no concern for the complaint about the bad service and in fact dismissed our concerns.  Tonight's experience was 100% a result of terrible management and may cost this restraunt a couple of good once a week regular patrons.

I've never been shopping for engagement rings before and the people there made it great. I knew exactly what I wanted going in, my girlfriend had sent me a bunch of creations off their website (which is an awesome resource) and I picked out the few that I liked.  It certainly helps to know the color differences (D, E, F, etc.), cuts (cushion, princess, emerald...) and clarity( VVSI, VSI, IF, etc.) before going in. That's just my personal preference. Whenever I'm buying something that's costing me twice as much as I paid for my car (which is a good ol reliable civic), I like to do my homework. But the staff is very knowledgeable about EVERYTHING jewelry. The big pluses of Shane Co for me personally include:\n-lifetime guarantee on products: pretty much fix anything you buy from them, for life. Except if it gets lost or stolen\n-60 day refund or exchange after purchase\n-6 month interest free loan to pay off whatever you buy. amount depends on cred score.\n\n2) These guys have to be trained on being low pressure. Because they let you browse around however long you want. And I must have been asked by 3 employees how I was going to propose to my gf.\n\n3) First we picked out a setting, then we went to stone. They run you through spiels about where diamonds come from, even bring out 3 mystery stone related to what you're looking for and let you guess the 4 C's. Kinda of fun. Let's you see what's important to you. After I picked out the stone, that was it. I made a down payment before leaving, got my cool IGI certificate for the diamond and then picked up the ring 2 days later.\n\n4)A big question I had before going in that I couldn't find the answer to on the internet was\""Can you negotiate prices?\"" And the answer is YES. The Shane Co rep gave this away when she asked me after I first walked in \""What out-the-door price were you looking at today?\"" After she wrote the amounts for the stone, setting, and tax on a little notepad I made an offer below the price. She walked away and got it cleared by her boss. I only bid about 5% off the price and was kind of wishing I had bid lower. But bottom line: Don't pay the tag price! \n\n5) Overall, I'm pleased with my purchase and comforted by the fact that if something were to happen to the ring I can always take it into any Shane Co location and know it's getting quality repairs for FREE.","The first of many wedding-related reviews I'll be writing over the next few months (blech, does it get any more girly? ah well).

It certainly helps to know the color differences (D, E, F, etc.), cuts (cushion, princess, emerald...) and clarity( VVSI, VSI, IF, etc.) before going in. That's just my personal preference. Whenever I'm buying something that's costing me twice as much as I paid for my car (which is a good ol reliable civic), I like to do my homework. But the staff is very knowledgeable about EVERYTHING jewelry. The big pluses of Shane Co for me personally include:\n-lifetime guarantee on products: pretty much fix anything you buy from them, for life. Except if it gets lost or stolen\n-60 day refund or exchange after purchase\n-6 month interest free loan to pay off whatever you buy. amount depends on cred score.\n\n2) These guys have to be trained on being low pressure. Because they let you browse around however long you want. And I must have been asked by 3 employees how I was going to propose to my gf.\n\n3) First we picked out a setting, then we went to stone. They run you through spiels about where diamonds come from, even bring out 3 mystery stone related to what you're looking for and let you guess the 4 C's. Kinda of fun. Let's you see what's important to you. After I picked out the stone, that was it. I made a down payment before leaving, got my cool IGI certificate for the diamond and then picked up the ring 2 days later.\n\n4)A big question I had before going in that I couldn't find the answer to on the internet was\""Can you negotiate prices?\"" And the answer is YES. The Shane Co rep gave this away when she asked me after I first walked in \""What out-the-door price were you looking at today?\"" After she wrote the amounts for the stone, setting, and tax on a little notepad I made an offer below the price. She walked away and got it cleared by her boss. I only bid about 5% off the price and was kind of wishing I had bid lower. But bottom line: Don't pay the tag price! \n\n5) Overall, I'm pleased with my purchase and comforted by the fact that if something were to happen to the ring I can always take it into any Shane Co location and know it's getting quality repairs for FREE.

Little pizzieria tucked away in the village center trails shopping center. From what i can surmise it's all family-owned and run and serves Brooklyn style \""fold-over\"" pizza though i'm hardly an expert.  Picked up a large cheese to share which was promptly ready on time. Crust was on the thin side like i like it but hand tossed and just the right amount of sauce. And they didn't skimp on the cheese. Basic little italy decor, with red checkered tablecloths and a help yourself soda fountain. Currently, it's 13.25 for the lg cheese (a little steep to me) but check the valu-pak coupons and get it for 9.99.

I almost complained, but what's the point, we are never going there again... better off going to and Humberto, Roberto, Filiberto...whatever you called those places... believe me you will never be this disappointed.
