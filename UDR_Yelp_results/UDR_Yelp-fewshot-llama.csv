My roommate and I decided to get pedicures on our vacation.  We tried to look up some locations and prices. We couldn't find many places that listed prices but ran across great reviews for the Qua Spa at Cesaer's on yelp and decided to make an appointment. It turns out that Qua is the spa and Color is the salon. We were a little disappointed because we wanted to see what Qua was like.\n\nWe were lead in and given mimosas. The place is very bright white and has a lot of marble. Allyn did my pedicure and was really nice and easy to talk to. The chairs have a great rolling massage option which was better than the typical vibrating chair massage. They also played fun top 40's which my roommate and I bopped along too as we joked around with our pedicurists. Allyn did slough off slightly too much skin because my toe had a tiny trickle of blood ( it's not her fault though, my feet are bone dry and prone to cracking, it also didn't hurt at all). Overall, it was a great experience. The only downside was the price- $100 for just a pedicure, but we figured we were on vacation in Vegas and just shrugged it off!

Huge fan of Mexican food., love coming here after drinking or a long day at work. They have the small tacos for like 70 cents or something like that. Also have the avocado slices which I love. They usually hook it up if you order a lot of food. I like that it's more authentic then a Taco Bell or Chi

You will never have anyone come up to you to greet and to help you!  It's because, yes, they have what appears to be cool fish, but if you inquire, they'll sell you an illegal fish, too!  If I was able to give a zero star rating, I feel that would be a too generous of a rating for Trop-aquarium.  So let me expand on the facts I've experienced with this company.  First off Trop-Aquarium is the company that installed my 500 gallon fresh water tank which is built in a double sided wall.  The reason why we chose them was because they were less expensive than all the other quotes we received.  But in this case you really get what you pay for and less.  The reason for obtaining such a large fresh water tank was because I love large fish like big parrot fish and mainly an Arrowana.  We had 35 very large fish in the tank that we paid handsomely to Trop- Aquarium.  One Friday at noon 6 of our large fish died so because Trop- Aquarium maintained our tank, I texted, called and left a message immediately!  No response for a whole 3 days.  By now I'm frantically calling them because all 30 of my expensive fish had died.  Finally they pick up the phone and asked if I had over fed the fish, giggling and that they'll come in a day or two.  However meanwhile I, an unexperienced aquarium maintainer, was told that I need to remove all 30 dead corpses and to buy an airline with air rocks, 2 large buckets, tube everything properly, catch the remainder live fish, place them in the properly tubed buckets all at 12:36 am midnight.  They also offered if I don't know how to just leave the tank with only the dead fish removed, but I was sure all the live fish would've died by the time they came.  When they finally came days after, they realized that they had not glued down the returns.  So all the fish brutally suffocated before dieing.  The Trop-Aquarium technician cleaned the tank, drilled random visible holes in the Clear Vision tank to stick the airline pipe attached to the air rock that I had both purchased.  They verbally admitted to the installation error!  They then replaced our dead fish with 5 fish which were the size of a silver dollar.  Soon after their billing called us and said we owed them over $1000 for the work they did to fix the installation problem they created!  I contacted other aquarium builders and when they saw the tank, all six companies stated and agreed that no one ever would build a tank with no overflow mini tank and returns at the bottom.  Trop-Aquarium did this so that they would be the exclusive company to convert the tank, maintain it and also this way, they'd make a larger profit!  So, in conclusion, if you have limitless amount of money to burn,  want the cheapest specimen of fish in your fish tank, never want to get a timely response, and over all get scammed in the long run, Trop-Aquarium would be perfect for you!!!  Time is the true revealer of how a people are and how companies truly operate.  During my rough 5 year relationship with Trop- Aquarium, I come to realization that making $$$MONEY$$$ is their only priority and having a honest customer oriented business is NOT!!!!!  I WOULD NEVER WISH THIS EXPERIENCE UPON ANYONE ELSE!  You may have to pay a little more initially with another company, but in the long run over all, you will exceed a great amount of money you ever envisioned with Trop-Aquarium.","I absolutely love this place!

So, in conclusion, if you have limitless amount of money to burn,  want the cheapest specimen of fish in your fish tank, never want to get a timely response, and over all get scammed in the long run, Trop-Aquarium would be perfect for you!!!  Time is the true revealer of how a people are and how companies truly operate.  During my rough 5 year relationship with Trop- Aquarium, I come to realization that making $$$MONEY$$$ is their only priority and having a honest customer oriented business is NOT!!!!!  I WOULD NEVER WISH THIS EXPERIENCE UPON ANYONE ELSE!  You may have to pay a little more initially with another company, but in the long run over all, you will exceed a great amount of money you ever envisioned with Trop-Aquarium.

I've been going back and forth as to how many stars this place should get.  I finally decided on 2 because I can't award 1/2 a star and feel 3 stars is too many.\n\nMy friends and I visited on a Saturday afternoon.  We entered and asked if we could sit in the bar area but we wouldn't be able to sit at the bar because there were too many of us.  The hostess was very short and said she would get something for us and be right back, then, she disappeared.  When she came back she led us to the furthest table from the bar.  Not what we wanted or asked for.  We decided we were going to ask for a table at the bar and was informed that outside was open seating- this would've helped when we asked the first time but, whatever.\n\nOur server was not the sunniest bulb in the box, meaning, she was not friendly.  Gosh, I hate that and it put me in a bad mood.  Last time I checked, she was there to help us at her own will, not against it.  Geesh.  We all had a couple drinks and some of us had appetizers.  They were good but nothing to write home about.  Bar food.\n\nMy favorite part of the evening was when my friends rode the bull.  It was entertaining.\n\nSo, in closing, go to ride the bull and then get the hell out of there.  Well, maybe stop at the bar and grab a drink first.

Worst customer service ever back in mid-January.  I'm a pretty chill, easy-going dude, but by the end of this visit I wanted to put every McD worker in a Ric Flair figure-four leglock. \n\nCashier was terrible.  Middle-aged dude looked like he was hating life (no comment here) and didn't greet patrons with anything more than a lazy nod.  He had to have been thinking, \""What the hell do you want?\""  A simple \""Hey, what can I get for you?\"" would have sufficed.\n\nI'm an optimist, but my orange juice was half-empty.  I hemmed and hawed about pointing it out, but did so.  Chick on duty returned with my juice filled with ice.  Really?  You don't think I can tell that its ice and not juice?  Later, chick said that the orange juice was not ready yet.  Might I suggest a solution?  GET IT READY - ICE IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE.\n\nBacon, Cheese & Egg Biscuit with no bacon, please.  It took them TWENTY minutes, FOUR different McD workers, and THREE breakfast sandwiches to get my friend's order right.  Not that difficult of an order - it doesn't mean a Sausage McMuffin without sausage; it doesn't mean a Bacon, Cheese & Egg Biscuit with egg; and it definitely doesn't mean a Sausage McMuffin without sausage, even the second time around.  \n\nDuring the BCE Biscuit incident, they still never gave me my coffee.  I politely informed the cashier, and the dude tells me he didn't forget it.  Let me guess, coffee beans aren't harvested yet and there wasn't even ice to try and trick me.  He then proceeded to pour me a cup.\n\nWhat a Mickey Mouse operation.  I will not come to this location again.\n\ndmo out.

At lot of attitude and bad food? No thanks.\n\nThere's a vicious cycle when it comes to making assumptions about your patrons. You think, 'they look young and they ordered tap water. I bet they aren't going to spend much money here. I am going to ignore them.\"" Well you know what happens when you never see your waiter again and have to order through managers all night? You get a bad tip.\n\nWe ordered some sangria, the red, which was alright but not great. Then we ordered a few plates of tapas, to get us started.

Thank goodness for Michaels!\n\nWhere the \""semi-creative\"" can actually pull something together and create a masterpiece. Haha! \n\nI was \""tasked\"" (ugh) to pick up supplies for our pumpkin contest at work. We had a \""theme\"" (kinda)...but no clue of how to make that happen. Thank goodness the staff was helpful! Walking into Michaels can be a bit overwhelming...ok, extremely overwhelming, especially with a not well thought out vision. However, I'm pleased to say I managed to leave with some good stuff and my co-workers were happy.  \n\nSo then why just three stars??? Simply put this store is just way too cluttered. It's not necessarily the fault of the staff, they really have no control of people leaving stuff just anywhere but it can make it hard finding what you need when you have to dig through cards, glitter ornaments, plastic flowers and stickers. \n\nBut if you are every tasks out for work projects, I definitely recommend stopping here to get the creative juices flowing.

We had our wedding reception at lakeside grill for 50 people in the vista room.   Christina Telese was my contact for the event, and she was nothing short of fantastic.  She really helped me get everything together and I could not have done it without her.  \n\nWe chose this location based on a couple of things.  \n1.  SW would not accommodate a party our size \n2. We have eaten here before and liked the food, although the service left something to be desired\n3. It's a beautiful space in a beautiful hotel\n \nThe menu we chose was their priciest at $150.00 pp.  Mostly everything was great but there were some misses.  Our menu consisted of... \n\n*Antipasto including iberico ham, manchego cheese, marinated olives & bread -  this was a hit.  everything was delicious\n\n*Black Truffle Arancini -  Delicious and they went fast\n\n*Whipped garlic feta cheese with mushrooms and bread - Could have skipped it\n\nShellfish Platters - made up of the largest shrimp I have ever seen, lobster tails, oysters and Alaskan king crab legs.  These were awesome.  everything tasted fresh and great.  Nice portion for everyone at our table\n\nSalad Course was good, tomatoes, garbanzo beans, peppers, manchego \n\nKing Crab Risotto -  This dish was very rich and very tasty.  the risotto was perfectly cooked.\n\nOur entrees consisted of \nDover Sole - my guests who ordered this said it was OK and wished they got something else.  It was not prepared properly\n\nFilet and Lobster tail -  the filet was perfectly cooked as were the lobster tales but the tales were tiny.  I mean baby lobster tiny.  Still very good though. \n\nBone in NY Strip - The steak itself was very good, however, our guests did not get a choice on temperature.  So most were very rare.  I know that this is typical for most large parties but still.. \n\nFor dessert we had an assortment brought to each table.  Nothing was really a stand out unfortunately.  \n\nThe service for the most part was great, the beginning of the meal felt very rushed to me.

It's the world's most complete animal protein.  Bodybuilders and Meatheads alike know...if you want more muscle, you must eat more protein!  I'm far from my early 20's when I used to add a raw egg or 2 to my daily whey protein & creatine shake, or eat 6 hard boiled eggs daily to help 'bulk up'...but I still love me some eggs early in the morning!\n\nThe Cracked Egg if you can't already tell is a breakfast-heavy joint.  They are usually only open daily for breakfast and lunch.  It's been voted 'The Best of Las Vegas' by the LVRJ at least 3 times.  So I figure instead of making my own breakfast we'd go check this place out.  \n\nThe day we went it was packed!  Of course, it was a Sunday and church was probably just letting out.  There's a big hustle and bustle here, no shortage of orders being called out, waitstaff running around with plates, and the smell of fresh coffee being brewed.  Man, do I love the first meal of the day!  Yes, I am a morning person.  Night owls beware!\n\nMenu is a good size and offers a ton of choices.  Now with The Cracked Egg being its namesake, please realize that most of their dishes require EGGS.  If you don't like eggs or egg products STEER CLEAR.  Should be obvious.  Go back to your overpriced lattes and friggin' scones.  Go dunk your donuts somewhere else.  Go back to your toaster to watch those tarts pop.  I feel sad for you folks.\n\nThe Cracked Egg has different parts to their menu.  There's \""Breanne's Basics\"" which  have your plain eggs & bacon, eggs & sausage, and similar type stuff here.  In \""Eggs With Attitude\"" these dishes are mostly various things scrambled with eggs, which they call a 'scramble'.  I much enjoy the Southwest Scramble which has 3 eggs scrambled with chorizo, green chiles, jalapenos, onion, jack & cheddar cheese, and a side of salsa.  \""The Benedicts\"" is self-explanatory, a list of all their different Eggs Benedict concoctions.  Me?  I like the good ol' regular Eggs Benedict standard, done right.  In the \""Fluffy & Folded\"" section you got your 3 egg omelettes, and my faves are The Denver with ham, bell peppers, onions, and cheese, or The Greek with spinach, tomatoes, and feta.  Yum!  \""Sin City Skillets\"" are for you wannabe cowboys who like your food coming in a cast-iron skillet, build your own or choose one off of their menu.  The last big breakfast section is \""From the Griddle\"" and includes their French toast choices as well as fresh pancakes.  From what I've tried and what I've heard...it's all pretty good stuff.  \n\nThe Cracked Egg also has non-breakfast stuff for you non-breakfast eaters too.  From sandwiches and salads, to burgers and homemade chili, it's all there.  But why come to a breakfast joint and not have breakfast?  It's like going to El Pollo Loco and asking for fish!  Try the breakfast.\n\nOnly gripe I have here is that the prices are a bit on the high side.  I could make some of these dishes at home easily for half the cost, and do just as good a job since I love making breakfast anyway.  Two folks eating breakfast with a cup of joe each will probably set you back $25+ after tax and tip depending on what you eat.  Worth it if you go every once in a while or on a special occasion.  Or if you're loaded like Steve Wynn.  Geez, that guy is rich.\n\nStop by The Cracked Egg, have a hearty breakfast, then bench press that little Fiat in the parking lot!","I've done Cracked Egg, Broken Yolk in CA, and now Egg Works.

There's a big hustle and bustle here, no shortage of orders being called out, waitstaff running around with plates, and the smell of fresh coffee being brewed.  Man, do I love the first meal of the day!  Yes, I am a morning person.  Night owls beware!\n\nMenu is a good size and offers a ton of choices.  Now with The Cracked Egg being its namesake, please realize that most of their dishes require EGGS.  If you don't like eggs or egg products STEER CLEAR.  Should be obvious.  Go back to your overpriced lattes and friggin' scones.  Go dunk your donuts somewhere else.  Go back to your toaster to watch those tarts pop.  I feel sad for you folks.\n\nThe Cracked Egg has different parts to their menu.  There's \""Breanne's Basics\"" which  have your plain eggs & bacon, eggs & sausage, and similar type stuff here.  In \""Eggs With Attitude\"" these dishes are mostly various things scrambled with eggs, which they call a 'scramble'.  I much enjoy the Southwest Scramble which has 3 eggs scrambled with chorizo, green chiles, jalapenos, onion, jack & cheddar cheese, and a side of salsa.  \""The Benedicts\"" is self-explanatory, a list of all their different Eggs Benedict concoctions.  Me?  I like the good ol' regular Eggs Benedict standard, done right.  In the \""Fluffy & Folded\"" section you got your 3 egg omelettes, and my faves are The Denver with ham, bell peppers, onions, and cheese, or The Greek with spinach, tomatoes, and feta.  Yum!  \""Sin City Skillets\"" are for you wannabe cowboys who like your food coming in a cast-iron skillet, build your own or choose one off of their menu.  The last big breakfast section is \""From the Griddle\"" and includes their French toast choices as well as fresh pancakes.  From what I've tried and what I've heard...it's all pretty good stuff.  \n\nThe Cracked Egg also has non-breakfast stuff for you non-breakfast eaters too.  From sandwiches and salads, to burgers and homemade chili, it's all there.  But why come to a breakfast joint and not have breakfast?  It's like going to El Pollo Loco and asking for fish!  Try the breakfast.\n\nOnly gripe I have here is that the prices are a bit on the high side.  I could make some of these dishes at home easily for half the cost, and do just as good a job since I love making breakfast anyway.  Two folks eating breakfast with a cup of joe each will probably set you back $25+ after tax and tip depending on what you eat.  Worth it if you go every once in a while or on a special occasion.  Or if you're loaded like Steve Wynn.  Geez, that guy is rich.\n\nStop by The Cracked Egg, have a hearty breakfast, then bench press that little Fiat in the parking lot!

However, it took almost 20 minutes to get a glass of water, another 25 minutes to get our beer, which we ordered once our water was delivered.

We noticed that the waiter had been bringing baskets of warm bread to the tables earlier, so I asked if it would be possible to get some bread while we waited for our food.  The waiter explained that 1) they were out of bread and were waiting for more to be delivered and 2) that even if they had bread that the oven was being used for something else and our bread would be cold.  He explained that we were \""first\"" on his list for bread once they got more bread.  About 20 minutes later, he brought us bread...it was cold, along with the butter.  My friend decided to heat the butter by holding it over the candle flame, which could have worked brilliantly, only the plastic packaging began to melt, so cold butter is what we settled for.  \n\nSalad was included with my meal, but not my friend's, so he ordered a salad in addition to his meal.

I was driving so asked if they could call back in an hour or two when I was home. \n\nAfter we hung up I got another phone call, and when I answered it turned out one of the installers had butt-dialed me back by accident and I could hear them talking about me.

What could have happened in an hour with a lone woman and a young toddler? Jan was obviously uninterested in me as a customer, judgemental and the worse salesperson ever.

House of Window Coverings has the most unprofessional and unhelpful employees ever. I wanted to redo all of the windows in my house and their designer Jan came to help me decide what to get.\n\nJan was rude, condescending and just snarky. I had to chase her back to her car, because I wasn't done. I really wanted the window coverings or would have given up. I decided to get shutters for the whole house, placed the order and put down the deposit.\n\nSeveral days later the installers called to schedule the measuring. I was driving so asked if they could call back in an hour or two when I was home. \n\nAfter we hung up I got another phone call, and when I answered it turned out one of the installers had butt-dialed me back by accident and I could hear them talking about me. Jan had told them seriously horrible things about me (we were together for like one hour with my then 18-month-old son at home) and I could hear them discussing it. Seriously? What could have happened in an hour with a lone woman and a young toddler? Jan was obviously uninterested in me as a customer, judgemental and the worse salesperson ever. The installers were saying how mean I was and I was mad because they called while I was driving. Really?

You enter on the main floor, so if you are there for EDM, stay there and no stairs. The main floor is the middle, so if you are there for hip-hop go downstairs, and now I can see a problem.\nSecond the non-VIP seating policy, there actually are places to sit for non-VIP. If you go downstairs, damn stairs!, you have two directions at the bottom, straight in the main room or do a 180 and walk down the hall.

Our order and meal went well and the food was tastey.  However I waited forever for my check.  I asked another server to let my waitress know I needed my check  but saw she had been seated a second table.  So I waited.  Then I got up and went to the kitchen door.  The other waiter came thru and said do you want to start tomorrow jokingly :) and then said she didn't come over yet??? and I said no.  So I go back to my table.  I then see the waitress at the computer assuming maybe she is preparing my check.  Wait. wait. wait.  Others at the table are getting annoyed too.  So I take my two pancakes on a plate up to the waitress.  I said I would like a box and my check please.  She is lost in a fog.  I said please get me a box and my check.  Again lost in fog.  I hand the plate to her and said I will meet you up front at the register.  I tipped her too and I really don't know why.  Should it take 2 hours to eat in an empty restuarant?

So nice to see the new I-Hop location at Cotswald and I had the opportunity to visit last weekend with two other adults a newborn and 6 year old.  The waitress was super sweet.  Our order and meal went well and the food was tastey.  However I waited forever for my check.  I asked another server to let my waitress know I needed my check  but saw she had been seated a second table.  So I waited.  Then I got up and went to the kitchen door.  The other waiter came thru and said do you want to start tomorrow jokingly :) and then said she didn't come over yet??? and I said no.  So I go back to my table.  I then see the waitress at the computer assuming maybe she is preparing my check.  Wait. wait. wait.  Others at the table are getting annoyed too.  So I take my two pancakes on a plate up to the waitress.  I said I would like a box and my check please.  She is lost in a fog.  I said please get me a box and my check.  Again lost in fog.  I hand the plate to her and said I will meet you up front at the register.  I tipped her too and I really don't know why.  Should it take 2 hours to eat in an empty restuarant?   What I really meant to say was are you supposed to wait for an hour after you eat to get the check??

Lets just say i am a very easy going & understanding person & it takes a lot to annoy me. Probably one of the worst experiences I have had at a place like this. I was visiting AZ last weekend, friends suggested I go here since its a new place in old town. Got there around 8.30 and after 25 mins of looking for table we found one. It took another 20 for someone to take our order (we ordered food & drinks). As we waited for our food  the rude bouncers came and asked us to get up and move to the next table, we did, then a few minutes later, they told us they needed the chairs we were sitting on, and they took those as well. At this point our table had been pushed completely In front of a hugeee fan, & we had no chairs. While standing around like fools & telling the bouncer had food coming,the bouncer said he would get us chairs & turn the fan off- it never happened. The next part is what ticked me off- the server brought our food and placed it right in front of the fan, allowing dirt & dust\nTo be blown on it, not to mention the cheese on my pizza coagulated within seconds. 10 mins after the food was just laying around . At this point I refused to eat the food & continued to finish my drink & asked for the bill to pay for my drinks. This is quite funny, I get the bill and they had charged me for my the food as well. Not one apology, not one 'let me see if I can find a table'. The server was nice enough to bring us 2 free beers which I didn't even touch because I was soo annoyed. But overall it was an unpleasant experience.

0,"I really wish Yelp would allow zero stars.\n\n\nSince Airpark Dodge is local We figured it would be a great place to go purchase our exact specification of a Jeep Grand Cherokee for exactly the cost we investigated as fair.\n\nWe attempted to make this purchase at Airpark Dodge using our own funding.  This process will include working out the deal over the phone....The below story can be summed up with Airpark's final statement to me as \""...if you do not finance through us we don't want your business and we want you to leave\""\n\nIn any case,  Airpark Dodge made this the most adversarial car purchasing experience I have ever had.  They are, in my opinion, the most extremely aggressive, misleading, non-scrupulous and untrustworthy dealership I have ever run across.  They wasted a full day of my time and I suggest, prior to going, you tread lightly and consider about anyplace else.\n\n***********************\nDuring the entire 24 hour process (to the hour) we were extremely clear we had our own financing with an extremely good rate (one they would either not beat or could barely match). In any case we clearly stated we are simply there to purchase the vehicle only and for the amount we required.  It was very clear nothing less than these statements would be acceptable and we wanted a quick and easy transaction.\n\nWe started the day with the requirements stated and accepted over the phone.  All we needed was the purchase agreement from them. And we would be on our way to the bank to pick up the check and make our purchase.\n\nWithout going into the line by line issues I will simply state a full day of \""misunderstandings\"" on totals, rebates, sums, flaws and missteps occurred.  They continuously sent incorrect data to give to the bank.  Not only incorrect data but incorrect paperwork.  It was extremely clear as to what we were looking for.  I find it very hard to believe they have never dealt with a customer in this manner.\n\nIt became obvious I would have to go and get it from them physically (which ends out being exactly what they wanted). Upon arrival the salesman attempted to have me sign all their standard applications for credit (of which I, again, clearly stated I wanted no part of).  In fact at one point he attempted to convince me it was for the purchase only that he required this information (this included my ssn).... I may be dense but not that dense and I clarified my position by statingif I gave you my ssn you do not have permission to run my credit.... Funny, he no longer cared to get that filled out and ran off to see his manager (and I had no intention of giving this to him anyhow)\n\nThe finance manager got into the mix, actually had the nerve to ask me to explain what the problem was.  After spending the last day working on this I was not about to describe the events of the day.  This particular question was a bit misleading as shortly after he talked as though he was fully versed in the situation.  I am pretty sure he was not fully versed in my particular situation, I sincerely believe he was versed in the script written for our particular purchasing requirement.\n\nWell as we know they said they don't want our business if we are not going to finance through them.  They also mentioned we will receive a negative review anyhow.... Guess they didn't think of yelp.\n\nI know I should have left sooner but was stuck on the good price I worked out......Really should have left sooner.\n\n.... And the rest of the story....\nThe next day we went to Chapman Dodge....the acquired the exact same (physically the same) vehicle and sold it to us for exactly our asking price.  The purchase experience was exactly what I hoped for, very smooth, no pressure, no worries.  I was very clear on what we wanted and the abided by our decisions and processed the paperwork for which we required.  \n\nI highly recommend you consider going to Chapman Dodge as you first attempt to purchase your vehicle.","This is my first Yelp review ever.

I really wish Yelp would allow zero stars.\n\n\nSince Airpark Dodge is local We figured it would be a great place to go purchase our exact specification of a Jeep Grand Cherokee for exactly the cost we investigated as fair.\n\nWe attempted to make this purchase at Airpark Dodge using our own funding.  This process will include working out the deal over the phone....The below story can be summed up with Airpark's final statement to me as \""...if you do not finance through us we don't want your business and we want you to leave\""\n\nIn any case,  Airpark Dodge made this the most adversarial car purchasing experience I have ever had.  They are, in my opinion, the most extremely aggressive, misleading, non-scrupulous and untrustworthy dealership I have ever run across.  They wasted a full day of my time and I suggest, prior to going, you tread lightly and consider about anyplace else.\n\n***********************\nDuring the entire 24 hour process (to the hour) we were extremely clear we had our own financing with an extremely good rate (one they would either not beat or could barely match). In any case we clearly stated we are simply there to purchase the vehicle only and for the amount we required.  It was very clear nothing less than these statements would be acceptable and we wanted a quick and easy transaction.\n\nWe started the day with the requirements stated and accepted over the phone.  All we needed was the purchase agreement from them. And we would be on our way to the bank to pick up the check and make our purchase.\n\nWithout going into the line by line issues I will simply state a full day of \""misunderstandings\"" on totals, rebates, sums, flaws and missteps occurred.  They continuously sent incorrect data to give to the bank.  Not only incorrect data but incorrect paperwork.  It was extremely clear as to what we were looking for.  I find it very hard to believe they have never dealt with a customer in this manner.\n\nIt became obvious I would have to go and get it from them physically (which ends out being exactly what they wanted). Upon arrival the salesman attempted to have me sign all their standard applications for credit (of which I, again, clearly stated I wanted no part of).  In fact at one point he attempted to convince me it was for the purchase only that he required this information (this included my ssn).... I may be dense but not that dense and I clarified my position by statingif I gave you my ssn you do not have permission to run my credit.... Funny, he no longer cared to get that filled out and ran off to see his manager (and I had no intention of giving this to him anyhow)\n\nThe finance manager got into the mix, actually had the nerve to ask me to explain what the problem was.  After spending the last day working on this I was not about to describe the events of the day.  This particular question was a bit misleading as shortly after he talked as though he was fully versed in the situation.  I am pretty sure he was not fully versed in my particular situation, I sincerely believe he was versed in the script written for our particular purchasing requirement.\n\nWell as we know they said they don't want our business if we are not going to finance through them.  They also mentioned we will receive a negative review anyhow.... Guess they didn't think of yelp.\n\nI know I should have left sooner but was stuck on the good price I worked out......Really should have left sooner.\n\n.... And the rest of the story....\nThe next day we went to Chapman Dodge....the acquired the exact same (physically the same) vehicle and sold it to us for exactly our asking price.  The purchase experience was exactly what I hoped for, very smooth, no pressure, no worries.  I was very clear on what we wanted and the abided by our decisions and processed the paperwork for which we required.  \n\nI highly recommend you consider going to Chapman Dodge as you first attempt to purchase your vehicle.

He had just stayed 5 nights in the Penthouse Suite at The Mirage, so while the room was quite different than we were used to, it was very clean, comfortable, and quite large for a typical hotel room. We paid $59/night for a Fri-Sat stay, which is far less than you could get for a similar room on the Strip. \n\nThe room was very nicely decorated in Earth tones. Our room had a very comfortable king sized bed, two night stands, a love seat in a small sitting area, dining table, and a television armoire. They haven't yet upgraded to flat screen televisions in the Deluxe King rooms, but we didn't spend any time in the room watching television anyway. There is a safe located inside the television armoire, which is very small, but suitable for cameras and small electronic equipment. \nAir conditioning worked very well, although the unit itself was somewhat noisy. This actually turned out to be a plus, as the night we arrived they were having a Zumba dance party by the pool, and listening to the air conditioner was more pleasant than the horrid music pumping out during the marathon exercise session\n. \nThe bathroom is small, but perfectly adequate. The biggest complaint was that the shower head was too low for my 6'3\"" sweetie. Otherwise, the bathroom was stocked with plenty of towels along with Bath and Body Works products. Hot water was plentiful and the water pressure was great.\n\nThe casino itself is awesome. Very large, plenty of slot machines and table games are available. The Silverton Rewards club provides great benefits, and we both received a pass to Seasons Buffet once we earned 50 points on the Rewards Card (which took all of about 20 minutes to earn). We are both non-smokers, and neither of us had any complaints about excessive smoke in the casino. In fact, the only time I ever noticed smoke was if a smoker sat down next to me. Wait staff in the casino was FAR superior to any of the casinos we played at on the Strip.\n\nThe restaurants at Silverton are fabulous. We ate at nearly every single restaurant on property and enjoyed them all. I wouldn't say that Seasons was the greatest buffet in the world, but it was clean, food was well stocked, and our waiter was right on top of everything. Mi Casa Cantina serves up excellent Mexican food at a very reasonable price. The Sundance Grill is open 24 hours and provides casual dining with late night food specials. We ate breakfast here; it was tasty and very budget friendly. Johnny Rockets is also located on the casino floor, but we did not eat here on this trip. The flagship of the Silverton dining experience is Twin Creeks- which is an absolute must-visit during your trip. It has a beautifully romantic ambiance, and serves upscale steakhouse fare at prices much lower than similar restaurants on the Strip. The Tomahawk Rib Eye was simply divine! I just can't say enough about this incredible restaurant and the amazing staff.\nThe Silverton is connected to a Bass Pro Shop. If you are into that kind of thing, this store is huge and gorgeous.

Neither one of us are into outdoor sports, so I can't comment on whether or not the place is overpriced.\n\nThe best thing about the Silverton is the overall atmosphere and service level. The staff members were all very accommodating, helpful, and extremely friendly. We didn't have a bad experience with a single staff member on property, and we went everywhere. Upon our arrival at around 11am, we had practically no wait for service, and the front desk clerk had no problem giving us an early check in time. All the housekeeping staff made sure to say hello anytime they walked by, and all of the wait staff members in the restaurants were attentive and friendly. The casino caters to a slightly older clientele with some locals, and since there isn't a nightclub on property, there is very little pretentiousness among the guests. Everyone we ran into was relaxed and polite. And then there is the convenience factor; everything at the hotel/casino is within a 5 minute walk from your room, and the hotel is all of 10 minutes away from the Strip. Free shuttle service runs from the hotel to the airport, and to Caesar's Palace on the Strip if you don't have a car. \n\nIf it sounds like I'm gushing upon the Silverton, it's because I am.

The casino and other general areas of the hotel are well maintained, good location.\n\nCons:  Rooms are dated and not very clean including the bathroom, furniture falling apart, hole in the wall, flickering lights, shower turns off for no reason, toilets that don't flush.  The elevators in the pyramid are nauseating.\n\nAs I stated earlier, its cheap and you get what you pay for.  Not horrible, but I will not be back at least as an overnight guest.  You can find other bargains on the strip with better quality.

I merely wandered in and right back out. \n\nGone is the crowd and the long wait on a weekend morning waiting for a Pischke's greasy and tasty breakfast. Gone is the kitschy decor that gave the place character. Gone are the sassy waitresses who looked like they needed a good night sleep. Gone are the bursting menus full of good eats at reasonable prices.\n\nReplacing all of this is a bland and boring decor, 50% fewer menu choices, and 50% higher prices. The place was pretty empty while every other breakfast place in the neighborhood (we drove past 5 others) was packed with a line going out the door. Here's a tip for Mr Robert McGrath - if you buy a successful restaurant, don't make drastic changes and jack up the prices... in other words - if it ain't broke, don't fix it. \n\nI'm actually kinda pissed too because I thought Pischke's was pretty good and it was definitely adding character to our city... what's there now is just another boring restaurant. There's plenty of those around here... Pischke's was unique to the area. When I visit my sister in Minnesota, she has some really neat breakfast places she takes me to that are decorated as an eclectic mess, but that blow you away with good greasy food and are dripping with atmosphere and fun. Same story when I go to San Diego or Long Beach to visit friends. Neat hip cities have neat hip breakfast joints. Well now we have one fewer. \n\nIt's true - I haven't eaten here and perhaps Robert McGrath makes the most bomb-ass bacon and eggs this side of the equator... but it would seriously have to blow my mind to put this place back on my list of places to go.

I must agree with Scott S, but I should point out that I'm probably even less qualified to write a review of this place as I didn't eat here... I merely wandered in and right back out. \n\nGone is the crowd and the long wait on a weekend morning waiting for a Pischke's greasy and tasty breakfast. Gone is the kitschy decor that gave the place character. Gone are the sassy waitresses who looked like they needed a good night sleep. Gone are the bursting menus full of good eats at reasonable prices.\n\nReplacing all of this is a bland and boring decor, 50% fewer menu choices, and 50% higher prices. The place was pretty empty while every other breakfast place in the neighborhood (we drove past 5 others) was packed with a line going out the door. Here's a tip for Mr Robert McGrath - if you buy a successful restaurant, don't make drastic changes and jack up the prices... in other words - if it ain't broke, don't fix it. \n\nI'm actually kinda pissed too because I thought Pischke's was pretty good and it was definitely adding character to our city... what's there now is just another boring restaurant. There's plenty of those around here... Pischke's was unique to the area. When I visit my sister in Minnesota, she has some really neat breakfast places she takes me to that are decorated as an eclectic mess, but that blow you away with good greasy food and are dripping with atmosphere and fun. Same story when I go to San Diego or Long Beach to visit friends. Neat hip cities have neat hip breakfast joints. Well now we have one fewer. \n\nIt's true - I haven't eaten here and perhaps Robert McGrath makes the most bomb-ass bacon and eggs this side of the equator... but it would seriously have to blow my mind to put this place back on my list of places to go. The empty seats told me the story anyway. Before I left, I told the hostess to put it back the way it was. \n\nI plan to actually have a meal there sometime and then post a proper review... until then, this will have to do.

0,"Still a fan here!  Shop Cardenas weekly to get dinner goods for Taco Night at our house!  This place is close to my work so I'm here at least twice a week for cheap produce and reasonably priced meats.  The selection is still great, and I've noticed over the months that more and more non-Latinos shop here!  Good job people!  Cheapy like me!  Their produce prices sure beat the local Albertson's and Vons and Smith's by a long shot.  The only other place I get veggies is the Asian market but that's only because those yummy types of veggies aren't found here at Cardenas.  Go ahead, ask the stocker where they keep the baby bok choy and the fragrant pears!  You will get a look of confusion.  Well, that could also be because the stocker doesn't understand English very well.  In either case, you're out of luck.\n\nCardenas is still mostly one stop shop for your Mexican needs.  Besides the large supermarket area, you still have your juice bar, bakery, deli, and tortilleria stations within the store.  The tortillas here are pretty good, I'm spoiled now...I only buy fresh made corn tortillas from the tortilleria for my tacos!  They taste 100 times better when they are made only a few hours ago.  Really makes a difference in your Mexican dishes.\n\nThe juice bar is tasty, with fresh concoctions of strawberry and watermelon juices, or a fresh fruit smoothie.  It's better if you know a bit of Spanish because the drink orders can get confusing.  Got what I thought was supposed to be a strawberry smoothie, but they for some reason added beets!  Tastier than I thought it would be but still, could have done without them.\n\nCardenas bakery goes all day long.  When you enter the store you constantly smell the aroma of fresh bread or pastries coming out of the oven.  Tip, always ask for the freshest stuff out of the ovens (usually will be on trays where the ovens are).  I find that sometimes the pastries in the case can be sitting there for a while, and Lord knows who's been touching them or who's kids boogie face got on them.  A sign that says 'Please use tongs' doesn't always fit the bill!\n\nI am often here for a quick lunch at the Cardenas deli, especially when they run their weekly specials.  $5 sale for a burrito al pastor?  $3 for a ham torta?

Still a fan here!  Shop Cardenas weekly to get dinner goods for Taco Night at our house!  This place is close to my work so I'm here at least twice a week for cheap produce and reasonably priced meats.  The selection is still great, and I've noticed over the months that more and more non-Latinos shop here!  Good job people!  Cheapy like me!  Their produce prices sure beat the local Albertson's and Vons and Smith's by a long shot.  The only other place I get veggies is the Asian market but that's only because those yummy types of veggies aren't found here at Cardenas.  Go ahead, ask the stocker where they keep the baby bok choy and the fragrant pears!  You will get a look of confusion.  Well, that could also be because the stocker doesn't understand English very well.  In either case, you're out of luck.\n\nCardenas is still mostly one stop shop for your Mexican needs.  Besides the large supermarket area, you still have your juice bar, bakery, deli, and tortilleria stations within the store.  The tortillas here are pretty good, I'm spoiled now...I only buy fresh made corn tortillas from the tortilleria for my tacos!  They taste 100 times better when they are made only a few hours ago.  Really makes a difference in your Mexican dishes.\n\nThe juice bar is tasty, with fresh concoctions of strawberry and watermelon juices, or a fresh fruit smoothie.  It's better if you know a bit of Spanish because the drink orders can get confusing.  Got what I thought was supposed to be a strawberry smoothie, but they for some reason added beets!  Tastier than I thought it would be but still, could have done without them.\n\nCardenas bakery goes all day long.  When you enter the store you constantly smell the aroma of fresh bread or pastries coming out of the oven.  Tip, always ask for the freshest stuff out of the ovens (usually will be on trays where the ovens are).  I find that sometimes the pastries in the case can be sitting there for a while, and Lord knows who's been touching them or who's kids boogie face got on them.  A sign that says 'Please use tongs' doesn't always fit the bill!\n\nI am often here for a quick lunch at the Cardenas deli, especially when they run their weekly specials.  $5 sale for a burrito al pastor?  $3 for a ham torta?  Often with a free drink?  I'm there!  I enjoy most of the fare at Cardenas, and it's great they have a free salsa bar to partake with each meal.

Good: \n + Excellent kiddie island - 4 stories of much fun and usable by adults.\n+ Very good set of toddler slides (choice of 4)\n+ New facility - opened in May 2013\n+ Excellent swimmer to lifeguard ratio\n+ Super fun rides including a slide racer where 5-6 sliders race down the watery rainbow slope\n+ Food taste - had a very tasty chicken teriyaki sandwich\n+ There are some water misters in the wait lines to keep you cool\n+ An excellent adjacent public park was fun to play in after we left the swimpark for the day\n\nBad:\n - Location. This new location is far, far off the Strip and requires a long drive to get there. Back parking lot is a hike to the front.\n - Cost. Everything costs so much - extra for parking, extra for tube rental, expensive locker rental, extra expense for line-jumping pass, extremely costly charge ($150) for cabana rental. This is on top of the hefty $40 per adult charge.\n - Changing Rooms. Little to no clothes changing stalls in both male and female bathrooms; very few showers.\n - Entry. Entrances to the wave pool and lazy river are narrow and cause congestion\n - Tubes. You have to haul your own float tube to the top of the rides - no conveyor belt to assist in getting the tube to the top\n - Wait time - longish lines (without the line jump band) meant a long wait between fun rides.\n - Special salt water conditioning system in pools is harsh on swim suits - my daughter's dark pink suit came home very light pink\n\nTip:\n* Take your own shade and chairs - those are in short supply\n* Be sure to wear flip-flops or watershoes to all the rides - there is a LOT of non-shaded cement and it gets very hot.

The beef had large veins of grizzle running down almost every bite.  The breaded chicken was so tough I couldn't finish it.

My father, who beat young Rex mercilessly if Rex called him anything but \""The Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora\"", was originally from the Northeast.  My father was an odd man, a brutal man, a man with big dreams and small child like hands.  On my fifth birthday he brought Rex with him as he knocked over a 7-11.  As Rex helped him tie up the store clerk he let me pick any one thing Rex wanted in the store.  Young Rex wandered around the store, trying very hard to not step in the pools of blood, Rex saw the object he wanted...Rex turned and said \""Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora can Rex have THAT?\""  He nodded.  Rex kicked the 87 year old man laying on some of it...and picked it up. It was a bag with a delicious cheesesteak in it.  Rex danced. Rex smiled. Rex took the wallet of a crying soccer dad.  Rex was happy.  Rex and Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora drove down the street, the sound of sirens in the distance fading...the smell of the cheesesteak wafting into Rex's young nasal passages.  A great cheesesteak is a gift from above.  A wallet filled with 20 dollar bills and an unused condom...icing on the cake.  After we divided the ill gotten booty, Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora always took 70% (until I turned 9...but that is another story)...Rex ate his cheesesteak.  Perfect bread. Juicy shredded meat. Perfectly cooked onions. The right amount of whiz. Juice ran down Rex's chin. Juice ran down Rex's hands. Rex shook in delight. That memory, and the 8 months Rex spent on the run after Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora ratted him out...will always be with him.\n\nPops Philly Cheesesteak is not only an insult to that memory it is an insult to all things with meat, cheese, bread or even hot foods.  The front page of the their website has a picture of their pitiful attempt of a cheeesteak...one of one of their abominations has green pepper on it. GREEN PEPPER!!  Let me explain something to all of you who are not from Philly...IF there was a place in Philadelphia that put green bell peppers on their cheeseteak...THE CITIZENS WOULD BURN IT DOWN!!!

In the worst of times people often think of the best of times.  Rex is no exception.  Gather around kids and let Uncle Rex tell you a story...when Rex was a small child he spent many a month on the East Coast. It was a magical time.  My father, who beat young Rex mercilessly if Rex called him anything but \""The Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora\"", was originally from the Northeast.  My father was an odd man, a brutal man, a man with big dreams and small child like hands.  On my fifth birthday he brought Rex with him as he knocked over a 7-11.  As Rex helped him tie up the store clerk he let me pick any one thing Rex wanted in the store.  Young Rex wandered around the store, trying very hard to not step in the pools of blood, Rex saw the object he wanted...Rex turned and said \""Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora can Rex have THAT?\""  He nodded.  Rex kicked the 87 year old man laying on some of it...and picked it up. It was a bag with a delicious cheesesteak in it.  Rex danced. Rex smiled. Rex took the wallet of a crying soccer dad.  Rex was happy.  Rex and Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora drove down the street, the sound of sirens in the distance fading...the smell of the cheesesteak wafting into Rex's young nasal passages.  A great cheesesteak is a gift from above.  A wallet filled with 20 dollar bills and an unused condom...icing on the cake.  After we divided the ill gotten booty, Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora always took 70% (until I turned 9...but that is another story)...Rex ate his cheesesteak.  Perfect bread. Juicy shredded meat. Perfectly cooked onions. The right amount of whiz. Juice ran down Rex's chin. Juice ran down Rex's hands. Rex shook in delight. That memory, and the 8 months Rex spent on the run after Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora ratted him out...will always be with him.\n\nPops Philly Cheesesteak is not only an insult to that memory it is an insult to all things with meat, cheese, bread or even hot foods.  The front page of the their website has a picture of their pitiful attempt of a cheeesteak...one of one of their abominations has green pepper on it. GREEN PEPPER!!  Let me explain something to all of you who are not from Philly...IF there was a place in Philadelphia that put green bell peppers on their cheeseteak...THE CITIZENS WOULD BURN IT DOWN!!!  It is ABSOLUTLEY 100% NOT ALLOWED IN ANY PLACE IN PHILADELPHIA!! Even if asked they WILL NOT DO IT!  So, first and foremost this is NOT A PHILLY CHEESESTEAK PLACE!!! IT IS NOT!

I'm always looking for a new spot to try and this place is about a mile from my house. We came in during happy hour and the place was pretty dead. Our server was nice and very attentive, but can tell he was bored with his lack of tables because he came over every 5 minutes. Food choices are American (burgers, salads, sandwiches).

So when the server came our way to take the order she went back to ask the cook if she wouldn't mind making it for her and the answer was something along the lines of 'Sure, I'll make it.'  Big props for making these two customers feel happy about that.  One thing, my sausage did end up looking like bacon...but I ate it anyway.\n\nOK, so this has to be categorized as a down, there's no way to put a happy spin on it.  The bathrooms...what in the world went on in the bathroom?  It looks as if somebody was having a battle royale in the one.  Maybe somebody was fighting a demon much like they do in the show Charmed.  I mean thank god I didn't mistake the Styrofoam cups for having anything else but soap in them.  Also, this place is really showing it's wear.  It hasn't been open that long, but it sure needs a bit of TLC and updating.

Let me start by saying WORST CUPCAKES EVER!  Seriously.  I'm not trying to be mean, but they were really the worst cupcakes I've ever eaten.  First of all they looked very unprofessional, I seriously think my 7 year old grand daughter could have baked and decorated better cupcakes!  The taste was very bland, poorly decorated and just plain BORING!  Don't waste your money on this crap.  Girls... maybe you should take up watching CUPCAKES WARS or take a professional baking class... just a thought.  Needless to say I will NEVER eat these again and NEVER recommend them! OVER PRICED AND DULL!

(1 hour body & 1/2 hour foot massage) We arrive at 8:32 and start filling out forms.  My wife's 1st question SPECIFICALLY asks for a strong therapist.  The receptionist says yes, there is a strong therapist.  My wife's 2nd question was if the therapist was Thai; the receptionist says no, they are Chinese...BUT they've been trained by a Thai therapist.  I have nothing against Chinese therapists (I am Chinese) when I am getting a Chinese massage.  The techniques are worlds apart.  The receptionist continues to say it's OK, many customers ask for these therapists, they are good, etc...\n\nSo we make the wrong choice and continue.\n\nWe change into their shirt and pants and lie down on the mat.  My massage starts with a foot rub and pressing on my legs.  Not much of a massage just kind of squeezing on my muscles.  Continued onto the rest of my legs.  After that she started to pull and bend my legs.  Not much pressure was being applied so I'm not sure what this \""exercise\"" was about.  Not much changed for the duration of the 1 hour.  A lot of of just lightly rubbing and petting like other Yelpers mentioned.  Rubbed my scalp, my ears, my back, my neck and my arms a few times.  Pulled on my fingers...THIS WAS NOT A MASSAGE.\nNow onto the last 1/2 hour, the foot massage.  The therapists actually switched at this point!  I didn't know what's going on until later.  Much of the same thing, squeezing my foot here and there and that's about it.\n\nMy wife is fuming about her massage while we're changing back to our clothes. \n\nFor her first hour, she had to tell the therapist where to massage and she needed to be stronger.  Nothing relaxing about this at all.  Kept telling her stronger, the therapist would press a little harder once or twice.  This one didn't have a clue of how or where to massage.  This went on for an hour.\nSo the therapists decide that they need to switch because the one massaging my wife was getting tired from using all her strength...WT??  My therapist had more energy because she was just squeezing my arms & legs, they switch so I get the tired therapist to massage my feet.  \nThe last 1/2 hour for my wife was exactly like mine, just a foot squeeze.\n\nSo we go to the front counter to tell the receptionist of what just happened.  She actually said to us, \""we came in too late in the day, all the therapists are tired.  It's time for them to go home.\""  If we knew this, we would not have even came here at all. I don't know why, but we paid and gave a tip...\n\nSo the next morning, I call and look for someone to talk to about my experience.  I called their other location and talked to a \""manager\"".  She took my number and said she'll call the \""general manager\"".\nI get a call and talk to this man and he said sorry I can't help you, you stayed for the 1.5 hours so I can't do anything for you.  I explained that what we received was not a massage and I shouldn't have to pay for this.\nHe said if the therapists used more strength, they can get in trouble if they hurt their customers.  I said they weren't even massaging their customers!  \nThis man is very impolite and did not care about customer service at all.  He hung up on me.\nOh yeah, he said we got a 20% new customer discount...we got a good price. Yeah right.\n\nPass on this place.

The receptionist says yes, there is a strong therapist.  My wife's 2nd question was if the therapist was Thai; the receptionist says no, they are Chinese...BUT they've been trained by a Thai therapist.  I have nothing against Chinese therapists (I am Chinese) when I am getting a Chinese massage.  The techniques are worlds apart.  The receptionist continues to say it's OK, many customers ask for these therapists, they are good, etc...\n\nSo we make the wrong choice and continue.\n\nWe change into their shirt and pants and lie down on the mat.  My massage starts with a foot rub and pressing on my legs.  Not much of a massage just kind of squeezing on my muscles.  Continued onto the rest of my legs.  After that she started to pull and bend my legs.  Not much pressure was being applied so I'm not sure what this \""exercise\"" was about.  Not much changed for the duration of the 1 hour.  A lot of of just lightly rubbing and petting like other Yelpers mentioned.  Rubbed my scalp, my ears, my back, my neck and my arms a few times.  Pulled on my fingers...THIS WAS NOT A MASSAGE.\nNow onto the last 1/2 hour, the foot massage.  The therapists actually switched at this point!  I didn't know what's going on until later.  Much of the same thing, squeezing my foot here and there and that's about it.\n\nMy wife is fuming about her massage while we're changing back to our clothes. \n\nFor her first hour, she had to tell the therapist where to massage and she needed to be stronger.  Nothing relaxing about this at all.  Kept telling her stronger, the therapist would press a little harder once or twice.  This one didn't have a clue of how or where to massage.  This went on for an hour.\nSo the therapists decide that they need to switch because the one massaging my wife was getting tired from using all her strength...WT??  My therapist had more energy because she was just squeezing my arms & legs, they switch so I get the tired therapist to massage my feet.  \nThe last 1/2 hour for my wife was exactly like mine, just a foot squeeze.\n\nSo we go to the front counter to tell the receptionist of what just happened.  She actually said to us, \""we came in too late in the day, all the therapists are tired.  It's time for them to go home.\""  If we knew this, we would not have even came here at all. I don't know why, but we paid and gave a tip...\n\nSo the next morning, I call and look for someone to talk to about my experience.  I called their other location and talked to a \""manager\"".  She took my number and said she'll call the \""general manager\"".\nI get a call and talk to this man and he said sorry I can't help you, you stayed for the 1.5 hours so I can't do anything for you.  I explained that what we received was not a massage and I shouldn't have to pay for this.\nHe said if the therapists used more strength, they can get in trouble if they hurt their customers.  I said they weren't even massaging their customers!  \nThis man is very impolite and did not care about customer service at all.  He hung up on me.\nOh yeah, he said we got a 20% new customer discount...we got a good price. Yeah right.\n\nPass on this place.  Unprofessional and bad service.\n\nToo bad this is the only Thai massage in PHX.

Fun atmosphere, and decent margaritas. If you plan on going order a cheese dip and drinks only. Skip the food and just have a couple drinks along with chips and salsa. Trust me, you will be glad you listened! Food is very bland and very expensive.

Some holidays stay with you for the wrong reasons. \nLet's see:\n* The horrendous smoke in the casino\n* The extremely rude security guards \n* The people banging on the doors all hours\n* or the loud grinding air-con. \n\nGreat place to stay if you were at a conference or not wanting any sleep. \n\nThe pool and spa closes at 6pm. What's with that? \n\nThese are not trivial things. The fun and enjoyment of Vegas made up for the accommodation. \n\nOh, I forgot to mention the terrible hawkers who hassle you at every entrance. How many times do you news to say 'No'. I was thinking of getting a shirt made up. \n\nWe checked out of here and went to the Bellagio. Spend the extra for quality service. \n\nOne positive, the room staff tried hard to make our stay pleasant. We tipped them well but everything else was a shambles. \n\nStayed in five hotels on out trip all around this price range. This one was easily the worst. \n\nOh, no Wifi either. WTF!

Came here for Sunday brunch and all I have to say is... meh. It was okay, nothing astounding or worthy of writing home about. They did have a decent selection of breakfast/brunch food, mediocre sushi bar/asian section, salad and small bites, and pretty good dessert spread (but honestly... it's DESSERT). I've gone to the Wynn and Bellagio buffets, both which outshine this one.\n\nThey had unique pancakes, such as the red velvet and guinness pancakes, but otherwise lacked anything too noteworthy.

Kind of a long walk if you're carrying all those luggage.\n\nI hate jumping from hotel to hotel, but since we wanted to extend our stay in Vegas and wanted a more convenient location on the strip, we searched the Internet and thought we got this great deal for a newly remodeled room.\n\nTHE ROOMS: \nIt's like taking a 1980's hotel room and \""renovating\"" it by cover ups. The rooms are repainted and floors were redone, and new beds. That's only the best part.\nThey have new vinyl wooden floor, no carpet except a small rug in the walk way. (Which is a good things so it doesn't stink from the 30 year old carpet.. lol)\nThe furniture as of the table, night light table, and TV stand are all kind of banged up and so ready for a face lift!\n\nThe room itself is OK., but the tiny bathroom is where I draw the line. The door hinges and side panels were all old and rusty. They're mildew stain on the corners and white tiles inside the bath tub. It's clean but it's old and it's falling apart. The bathroom floor tiles were black and dingy, guess when they replaced the room's floor, they couldn't budget another 60 square feet of flooring in for bathroom, instead they rather gross out their guests.  They have nearly to none amenities. No slippers, not even coffee maker. Even the Motel 8 down the street has a coffee maker. They have an old wall burnt out hair dryer. I wouldn't risk it, because it looks like it's ready electrocute you when you turn it on.\n\nIf they did a remodeled, why didn't they just rip everything apart and replace it back with a everything new, this way, it really looks like they took the easy way out. Cover the stain up but not cleaning it out!! Although it may not be that bad, but thought of it, is kind of disgusting. There is no fan blower in the small tiny bathroom. So if any one have to go #2, make sure you buy a room spray for the bathroom. Without the bathroom fan, even when I take a shower, I have to leave the door with an open airway, or else I would suffocate in the hot steam.\n\nThe air conditioning is hell LOUD! If you're a light sleeper, make sure it's off! \nWe were in room 7084 and 7086 with a connecting door with old rusted door knob and chain. We had a great view of the strip right in front of the Caesar Palace fountain... It would have been so much prettier if the windows were clean. It was so disgusting and barely can see through the windows for the view.\n\nWould I stay here again?.. probably not unless I was desperate.. The parking structure and valet is very inconvenience. It's only idealistic to stay here if you go out walking from casino to casino. But we don't. We just drive around and when we get back to the Flamingo, we just stay at the hotel/ casino.","Good for the price. Not the most luxurious place to stay at in Vegas.

Tasteful, well-priced and not cheesy! \n\nBefore booking my room at the Rumor boutique hotel I honestly had never heard of it. I mean who goes to Vegas to stay off the strip right? Well I do! I've been to Vegas so many times and dealt with the strip congestion enough to know I want to avoid it if po

Do not be lured in to this hotel by its cheap rates and \""newly remodeled\"" room pictures!!  \n\nMaybe some people will call me a hotel snob after reading my review. But when I spend money for a good night of sleep, I want to enjoy my sleep and not worry.\nPerhaps I stayed at the 5 stars hotel more then the regular 3 stars one in Vegas, but even a nice motel is better then staying here.\n\n2 1/2 stars for the room itself.

My wife bought me a gift card to V's for Christmas 10 years ago.  I was skeptical at first ...I'd been an $8 haircut guy up until then... but that all changed.

To men who are still paying $15-$25 for styles at super cuts, or other \""chain\"" style shops/salons, wake up.

Excellent, excellent sushi. And really, I did not find the prices to be that outrageous. I had dinner for two, with alcohol and an appetizer and the whole thing was under $50. Everything was superb, from my extra strong and yummy Saketini, to the exquisite lobster rolls in a hollandaise sauce we had
