0,"When I signed my lease they told me they recommend having the apt. sprayed for pests EVERY MONTH. The manger admits they have a roach problem and the pest control man told me as soon as it warms up the \""water bugs\"" meaning big roaches will show up. There is a pigeon infestation that is so bad when the wind comes up, there are feathers flying all over outside - it looks like you are inside a room full of birds. They poop on my stairs, entry way, live on my roof, near my air conditioning unit, feathers come in from the dryer vent. The pigeons sit in the dumpsters so when you put a bag of garbage in the dumpster, they fly up and get agressive and dustr and mites go all over the place. I get bit from bird mites when I go to get my mail. Have to wear long pants, socks and shoes to not get bit. My kitchen sink drains out in front of my apartment out into the parking area so there is always a stream of water there. I can see soap suds under the front of my building. Kitchen is a mess. Dishwasher opens across the two sinks, try putting dishes in when you have to move away from the sink, the refig is old and lopsided so the door won't stay open. Cupbards are so small I have to turn my dishes sideways to get them in. No linen closet, stacked washer & dryer with NO place to put laundry stuff. I contacted the manger because I have a bug infestation, which I showed the bugs to the police and they told me to contact the management and have pest control come out and find out what they are. Manager will not respond, I made second request in person in the office, still no response, now the management doesn't speak to me. My guess is several people got bird mites from the pigeon infestation so they are ignoring finding out if the bugs are bird mites. I lost my clothing and belongings due to it, am moving in 11 more days. Yes the view of the golf course is pretty, but the old men in the golf carts go right up to your bedroom and livingroom windows. You have NO privacy at all.I can hear my neighbors do laundry, shower. I fell sorry for the lady below me because I have to do so much laundry due to the bug infestation.","Rate the following statement ""very negative"", ""negative"", ""neutral"", ""positive"", or ""very positive"".

I ordered a juice which took longer than it should bc they have one juice area and it was crowded with servers. \nNow for what I really minded...\nMy food took about 35 minutes to come out and when it did, it was all wrong and tasted terrible. Hash browns are made in house but even after ordering them crispy, they came out wet and undercooked in the center. The only thing crispy was the outside. My eggs were ordered over medium but came out so undercooked. Just white slime on top. The sausage links are butterflied and you get 2 links instead of 3 like every other breakfast place. They obviously slice them so it looks like more. I didnt really mind that bc I can never finish 3, but I didn't like the taste. My English muffin was thick and doughy, not toasted. DISASTER!

Statement: I don't get items dry cleaned very often, so when I needed to have a formal dress cleaned, I wasn't sure where to go.  Even though I had coupons in my Bucky Book for three other cleaners, I decided to use Right Touch after reading the Yelp reviews (those other cleaners scored very low, and Right Touch scored very high).  \n\nMy dress had only been worn once, and it had a large dark stain on the front.

They get points for being quick (only waited about 5 minutes) and friendly. Unfortunately, that's about the best thing about this place. I ordered 2 carne asada tacos and 2 al pastor tacos. The tortillas were thick and gummy. The asada was dry and had little flavor. The al pastor was excessively greasy and the fries were forgettable. This might be good drunk food at 4 in the morning, but when you're sober... not so much.","Rate the following statement ""very negative"", ""negative"", ""neutral"", ""positive"", or ""very positive"".

And it didn't let us down. :-)\nWe had the deep dish cheese with extra cheese, and we should have paid attention to the number of people it serves. We ordered a large, because we love pizza, and could only finish about a quarter of it. The thing must have weighed 10 pounds! A very dangerous meal, since you know you should stop eating it, but it tastes so good you just have to have another bite,and another, and another...you get the picture. :-)\n\nSince it was an estimated 25 minutes for the pizza to cook, we decided to have an appetizer. That was the first mistake of our visit. We had the eight piece serving of fried mozzarella triangles. The mistake was not because the mozzarella triangles were not good, they were very good, but they took up more space in the tummy that the pizza could've filled. \n\nAll leftovers were nicely packed up in containers for us to bring back to the hotel. Good thing we had a refrigerator in the room :-) \n\nThe restaurant has a sports atmosphere, clean tables, a lot of sports pictures around the room. Very 50s diner type atmosphere :-)\n\nWe were staying on the strip, so I would recommend visiting Amore if you're renting a car. We actually rented a car for a day (5/1/14) just to make the trip to Amore. The cab fare alone would have been more than the car rental, and that's not including the tip. (According to a web site that estimates cab fares, it was a $60 round trip fare from the Mirage hotel.)\nWill definitely do it again on our next visit back to Vegas :-)","Rate the following statement ""very negative"", ""negative"", ""neutral"", ""positive"", or ""very positive"".

0,"If you read my reviews in the past, I'm always writing a very positive and honest review.  Please don't be fooled when you walk in their store.  You will never have anyone come up to you to greet and to help you!  It's because, yes, they have what appears to be cool fish, but if you inquire, they'll sell you an illegal fish, too!  If I was able to give a zero star rating, I feel that would be a too generous of a rating for Trop-aquarium.  So let me expand on the facts I've experienced with this company.  First off Trop-Aquarium is the company that installed my 500 gallon fresh water tank which is built in a double sided wall.  The reason why we chose them was because they were less expensive than all the other quotes we received.  But in this case you really get what you pay for and less.  The reason for obtaining such a large fresh water tank was because I love large fish like big parrot fish and mainly an Arrowana.  We had 35 very large fish in the tank that we paid handsomely to Trop- Aquarium.  One Friday at noon 6 of our large fish died so because Trop- Aquarium maintained our tank, I texted, called and left a message immediately!  No response for a whole 3 days.  By now I'm frantically calling them because all 30 of my expensive fish had died.  Finally they pick up the phone and asked if I had over fed the fish, giggling and that they'll come in a day or two.  However meanwhile I, an unexperienced aquarium maintainer, was told that I need to remove all 30 dead corpses and to buy an airline with air rocks, 2 large buckets, tube everything properly, catch the remainder live fish, place them in the properly tubed buckets all at 12:36 am midnight.  They also offered if I don't know how to just leave the tank with only the dead fish removed, but I was sure all the live fish would've died by the time they came.  When they finally came days after, they realized that they had not glued down the returns.  So all the fish brutally suffocated before dieing.  The Trop-Aquarium technician cleaned the tank, drilled random visible holes in the Clear Vision tank to stick the airline pipe attached to the air rock that I had both purchased.  They verbally admitted to the installation error!  They then replaced our dead fish with 5 fish which were the size of a silver dollar.  Soon after their billing called us and said we owed them over $1000 for the work they did to fix the installation problem they created!  I contacted other aquarium builders and when they saw the tank, all six companies stated and agreed that no one ever would build a tank with no overflow mini tank and returns at the bottom.  Trop-Aquarium did this so that they would be the exclusive company to convert the tank, maintain it and also this way, they'd make a larger profit!  So, in conclusion, if you have limitless amount of money to burn,  want the cheapest specimen of fish in your fish tank, never want to get a timely response, and over all get scammed in the long run, Trop-Aquarium would be perfect for you!!!  Time is the true revealer of how a people are and how companies truly operate.  During my rough 5 year relationship with Trop- Aquarium, I come to realization that making $$$MONEY$$$ is their only priority and having a honest customer oriented business is NOT!!!!!  I WOULD NEVER WISH THIS EXPERIENCE UPON ANYONE ELSE!  You may have to pay a little more initially with another company, but in the long run over all, you will exceed a great amount of money you ever envisioned with Trop-Aquarium.","Rate the following statement ""very negative"", ""negative"", ""neutral"", ""positive"", or ""very positive"".

So for a person like me, i go to Vegas for the lavish hotels, morning mojitos, the tricked out pools, and the like. Encore provided just that. Anyone that has walked through Encore knows that the colorful interior with the mosaic tiles and slightly asian inspired (subtle) decor makes for sophisticated without crossing the line over to gaudiness.\n\nThe spa lounge area (can see it when one is crossing over to the XS pool area) is soo pristine- i wished my gfs to be there- they would have gotten excited about it more than J! The pool itself has two sections. One is directly connected to the spa and on the other side is the European style \""xs pool\"" - although we didnt see more than 3 brazen topless women, it was a big area for sunning and playing blackjack (same area they do at nighttime at the club)\n\n\nAs for the rooms, we had requested a \""quiet suite\"" since Encore is known to have loud music coming from XS at 4 in the morning.. so we got a north facing room.. Not the greatest view (just small strip plaza) but the King Suite (which is the smallest room at Encore I believe) was pretty spacious for 2 people.\n\nAnother thing- I dont know if anyone else notices but the music they constantly play in the casino is by Kaskade. I've heard at least 3 Kaskade songs during this stay and I remember hearing her 3 years ago when i was in this hotel as well- and i actually went home to look up who this artist was- and has made a permanent spot on my ipod playlist. For those that know of this artists work, it adds a serene element to the casino.\n\nOne of the only negatives to Encore/Wynn properties.. they are so damn far from everything else! We spent most of the trip at this hotel (except for the dinner/show which we cabbed to Bellagio- but the cab driver insisted taking some freeway looking road to get from Encore to Bellagio due to traffic ??)\n\nThey sometimes send deals over- one that i got in the mail which was 3 nights for 300 (incl weekends)- Except J threw it away and we didnt get to use it!

0,"First yelp. Be kind. :)\n\nWas Friday lunch when a friend and I decided to try this local joint. It's located in a shopping center, next to the mega Lifetime gym in Gilbert. Easy to miss since it's tucked away in the corner but just know that it is in the same plaza as Zipps Bar and Grill. \n\nThe place was quaint, non pretentious, hybrid of a cafe and fast food set up, which is a casual place to relax and catch up with a friend. They have a couple patio sets out front to dine at as well. \n\nMost traffic coming in and out of the restaurant that day was for take out. The menu looked fresh and tasty. Their website is done well and was one of the reasons that got me here in the first place. Prices are good for the amount of food you get. \n\nI ordered the Spicy Chicken Wrap. It was the size of a Chipotle burrito but with much bolder flavors and a punch. It was filled with rice, black beans, chicken in a wonderful spicy sauce, jalapenos and other goodness that tasted really well together. Came with a side of yogurt sauce that helped balance the heat. Really was a great meal enveloped in a warm flour wrap. Couldn't finish the darn thing so let my friend have at it and he agreed to the tastiness. My friend got the Chicken Shawarama which I had a taste. Chicken tender, more fresh veggies so it is lighter than the Spicy Chicken, but still very well seasoned. It's wrapped in a Pita for easy enjoyment! For both, bill was about $13. \n\nIn all, great tastes, good prices, easy atmosphere.

Easy to miss since it's tucked away in the corner but just know that it is in the same plaza as Zipps Bar and Grill. \n\nThe place was quaint, non pretentious, hybrid of a cafe and fast food set up, which is a casual place to relax and catch up with a friend. They have a couple patio sets out front to dine at as well. \n\nMost traffic coming in and out of the restaurant that day was for take out. The menu looked fresh and tasty. Their website is done well and was one of the reasons that got me here in the first place. Prices are good for the amount of food you get. \n\nI ordered the Spicy Chicken Wrap. It was the size of a Chipotle burrito but with much bolder flavors and a punch. It was filled with rice, black beans, chicken in a wonderful spicy sauce, jalapenos and other goodness that tasted really well together. Came with a side of yogurt sauce that helped balance the heat. Really was a great meal enveloped in a warm flour wrap. Couldn't finish the darn thing so let my friend have at it and he agreed to the tastiness. My friend got the Chicken Shawarama which I had a taste. Chicken tender, more fresh veggies so it is lighter than the Spicy Chicken, but still very well seasoned. It's wrapped in a Pita for easy enjoyment! For both, bill was about $13. \n\nIn all, great tastes, good prices, easy atmosphere. I would come back. \n\nOnly thing that I can dock on was that it was a tad bit slow to get our food considering we were the only ones there and no AC for first 15 minutes of sitting down but I had good company so its a minor critique.

Very subtle and elegant. Potatoes were perfectly salty and nicely crispy. \n2.  Pain perdu was wonderful with accompanying compote of cranberry which was not too sweet.  The creme fresche too.  \n3.  Great setting and decor.\n4.  Friendly service, if a bit lazy. Manager did not seem warm and welcoming. \nBAD: \n1.   Green tea was badly executed.  Maybe 3-4 grams for 400ML.  Temperature about 190.  That is terrible, and tasted terrible.  It was prepared with a paper tea bag-most tea drinkers know that paper tea bags leave residual bad flavors, and this one did.  Green tea is supposed to be executed between 150-180.  3-4 grams should be about 120-180ml. \nWaiter insisted that the second green tea was called \""crocetia\"" a Japanese tea.  I told him that I didn't believe there was any such Japanese tea, and asked him to bring the bag over.  He refused at first, and insisted that it was indeed Crocetia.  He  later did bring the bag.  It was not crocetia but kokeicha.  I didn't know if it was \""formed\"" tea or \""twig\"" tea, so I decided not to order since I was getting a pretty typical Quebec \""I don't know and I'm not going ot find out experience\"".  The genmai cha was week, tasted bad and smelled funny.  The manager had to be told to take it off the bill despite my telling him the tea was bad.  Also a typical Quebec experience. \n2.  The smoked salmon was supposedly made by an artisinal smoked salmon maker.  They need to find a better one.  Lemeac has much better salmon with real character.  Lawrence as well.  Both make their own.  This is a high end place and this salmon tasted almost as though they were trying to replicate a salmon that people who frequent ordinary delicatessens in New York might like.  It's color and texture were disapointing.  there wasnt' the firm waxy smoothness or the smokiness of a good Scottish or Norwegian style salmon.  It tasted like cheap deli nova which in NY mostly comes from the same provider.  It is too soft, a strange color and lacks firmness, smokiness and good flavoring. \n3.  Presentation-great except for a pooling of grease on our plate under the potatoes. \n4.  Didn't offer additional coffee-had to ask for my wife who had said, \""maybe they charge for additional coffee\"".  \n5.  No bread provided-perhaps you have to order it and pay for it.  \n6.  Prices were high and the product was not as good as other less pricey restaurants for breakfast.\n7.  Manager had to be asked to take the tea off the bill-seemd a little testy about that.  Should have offered when I cgave him my comments.  Did not.  That is unacceptable in a restaurant like this.  \n8.  Bagel was hard and dry. \n9.  Cream cheese was nothign special.

It took them TWENTY minutes, FOUR different McD workers, and THREE breakfast sandwiches to get my friend's order right.  Not that difficult of an order - it doesn't mean a Sausage McMuffin without sausage; it doesn't mean a Bacon, Cheese & Egg Biscuit with egg; and it definitely doesn't mean a Sausage McMuffin without sausage, even the second time around.  \n\nDuring the BCE Biscuit incident, they still never gave me my coffee.  I politely informed the cashier, and the dude tells me he didn't forget it.  Let me guess, coffee beans aren't harvested yet and there wasn't even ice to try and trick me.  He then proceeded to pour me a cup.\n\nWhat a Mickey Mouse operation.  I will not come to this location again.\n\ndmo out.

0,"I had one of the worst experiences of my vegetarian life here. I had been to Johnny Rocket's before and gotten the vegan option so I knew I would be ok going here. I was out with my meat eating sister and my pescatarian husband so I figured this place would be the best for all three of us to get what we want. \n\nWe get in and I ordered a burger that wasn't the Streamliner (1st mistake), and just ordered it with the BOCA burger. The waitress takes our order, my husband also ordered his with a BOCA. \n\nAbout 20 minutes later the food comes out. The patty looks right. I was a little apprehensive and I should have gone with my gut feeling on not eating here this day, but I ignored it. It had been awhile since I had eaten a BOCA patty (over a year), so I THOUGHT it looked right. (2nd mistake)\n\nI start eating it and about half way through it the bill hits our table. It was crowded in there so the waitress must have been trying to get us out of there. So I look at the bill and notice both my husband and my burgers say Turkey substitution. I immediately start to freak out. We call the waitress over and explain to her that we ordered BOCA, why does it say Turkey? She then tells us that it is BOCA it just says turkey. I say, no that doesn't sound right. So she goes to talk to her manager I guess because we never saw her again. The manager comes over to our table and apologizes profusely for what happened. I'm upset because how the hell do you confuse BOCA and Turkey? I mean, really. I know some people might think how did I not know the difference. And I thought that to myself as well, but the truth is it slipped by me even though it shouldn't have. And it hurts me every time I think about it. I will never come to this Johnny Rockets again, if any of them ever again because of this experience. \n\nAll I can say is, if you are vegan or vegetarian, and you go to any of the Johnny Rockets, make sure that your waitress/waiter knows that a BOCA burger isn't meat.

0,"Came back for dinner on a Sunday night - the place was WAY less crowded then it was when we first visited.  Could be that it was not a popular day to go out to eat, or that the excitement of the grand opening has died down, or it could be that we came during the Steelers/Jets playoff game and everyone was at a bar somewhere.  Whichever.  It was quieter, in a good way.  They have a full bar now, and the TVs were playing the game, not Bollywood movies.\n\nWe got the buffet, which I think was about $10.  They had a pretty good selection of things - several vegetarian offerings (aloo gobi, chana masala, potatoes in spinach, paneer in tomato sauce), and chicken tikka masala, tandoor chicken, goat biryani, spicy chicken wings, and various other things.  Also two soups, a little salad area, a handful of condiments/chutneys, and a few sweet dessert-ish things.  And naan.\n\nEverything was pretty good - on the lukewarm side, as per usual for a buffet, but I appreciated the wide variety of options.  It was a good deal for the price.  Still, I think the quality (and temperature) of the food is higher when you order off the menu.  Nothing wowed me enough to bump them up to a four-star review.  it was standard Indian buffet fare - tasty, well-priced, all the usual suspects.

Upon walking in I immediately notice it is a tad smaller compared to the other popular joints in town.  It wasn't busy at all because there were 2 tables with customers, which worked in our favor because our food came out within 10-15 minutes. We ordered batchoy, some type of crispy house special noodle, sauteed shrimp, fried flounder, and salt and pepper pork chop. The batchoy was kind of whatever wish we would of ordered a tastier vegetable dish, the noodles were good, but I was not in awe, sauteed shrimp was accompanied with onions and green peppers, but the onions made up 75% of the dish and the dish overall was okay. Fried flounder was crisp, but another \""okay\"" taste as well. And most places don't mess up salt and pepper pork chop. Food was between okay and good, but I have definitely had better. On the plus side the service was good for a Chinese place because our server Jing gave us all our needs.

Upon walking in I immediately notice it is a tad smaller compared to the other popular joints in town.  It wasn't busy at all because there were 2 tables with customers, which worked in our favor because our food came out within 10-15 minutes. We ordered batchoy, some type of crispy house special noodle, sauteed shrimp, fried flounder, and salt and pepper pork chop. The batchoy was kind of whatever wish we would of ordered a tastier vegetable dish, the noodles were good, but I was not in awe, sauteed shrimp was accompanied with onions and green peppers, but the onions made up 75% of the dish and the dish overall was okay. Fried flounder was crisp, but another \""okay\"" taste as well. And most places don't mess up salt and pepper pork chop. Food was between okay and good, but I have definitely had better. On the plus side the service was good for a Chinese place because our server Jing gave us all our needs. I hate to mention their competitor on here, but HK Star will still be my spot for getting my Chinese fix on. Thank you!

I ordered the popsicle that I had heard so much about. They said they were out of them but would give me a vanilla cone and I could put the toppings on it. I was served  two scoops of ice cream in a waffle cone. There were three small bowls with it. In them was chocolate pearls, chocolate sauce and something I couldn't identify. I think it was browned coconut. I wasn't impressed at all. The chocolate was to fancy for me I guess. If I'm going to pay $8.00 for an Ice Cream cone I would like it to be more spectacular.

We were both super excited to get a Greek place nearby and had waited anxiously since we saw the signage up prior to opening.  It was pretty disappointing, I am sad to say :(\n\nWe had to wait about 5 minutes at the counter to place our order and finally, I think one of the owners, came over to assist us in our order.  We waited almost 40 minutes for one gyro plate and one souvlaki plate although they did bring out soup samples to all the tables which was very thoughtful.  The gyro was nothing to write home about, the meat on the top of the pita was very very crispy, crunchy in fact which oddly enough, added a pleasant texture.  The sauce was standard and was just the right amount.  The rice was a STANDOUT....super fluffy but in need of a little more seasoning.  My husband's souvlaki pita was tasty, the meat was lean, moist and cut in perfect sizes for the wrap.  Fries were standard with a slight sprinkle of parmesan and parsley.\n\nDeco was a little weird...........a map of Manzanillo Mexico in a Greek place was a little weird not to mention the Asian/Chinese art on the tables.  Television was quite loud and obtrusive, maybe a little mood music would be a better choice at night.  The service was really slow, they have been open a couple weeks now so maybe they are still getting the feel for the layout.  It was super clean, a positive for me :)\n\nI may go back in at lunch time perhaps to try out another dish.  I am really hopeful that they are able to maintain and stay open as every other establishment in this corner has closed previously.","Rate the following statement ""very negative"", ""negative"", ""neutral"", ""positive"", or ""very positive"".

0,"I went yesterday with my friend, having bought a groupon that covered the session fee, hair, makeup, a dvd slide show, and one 8x10.  The appointment was easy to make, and they called to confirm 2 days before the appointment, which is always appreciated because sometimes you forget.\n\nThere is one viewing area, where they can do one session at a time, towards the front.  It is not private, so if you are doing boudoir photos, I hope you're not exactly shy.  There's a partition up to shield it from the passing public's view, but there's no privacy if someone comes in to book an appointment, or even just stands in the hallway.  Not many people want to do boudoir photos and have them easily viewed by everyone that passes by.  The area in the back could have been set up as an additional viewing area, it would be more private, and cut down on waiting times.\n\nThere is only a set of curtains that is used when a session is going, and I witnessed a family passing by, and their child peeking in on people.  Again, I hope you're not shy!\n\nThis business needs a THOROUGH scrub down.  There was debris from different props all over the ground, the floor was scuffed up and dirty (and they expected you to sit on it in your panties if you were doing boudoir photos), there was a musty smell about the whole place, I can only imagine what would come up from the carpets in a proper cleaning, and the bathrooms were absolutely cringe worthy.  There was no attempt to clean the room between customers and the employees seemed to take no pride in their work place.  There were photographers and hair and makeup people sitting around.  No one cleaned anything, except the hair and makeup people keeping their stations tidy (good job ladies!)  I'm willing to bet when it's quitting time, no one runs a vacuum or sweeps anything, it's lock up and run for the exit.\n\nThere was nowhere to store your things for outfit changes, so when you're going between each of the sections of the room (and they will make you move, taking pictures against every single background), you have to move your things (or store them in the hallway, risking theft.)\n\nThey made no attempt, when booking the appointment, to ask if a female or male photographer would be preferred, knowing it was for a boudoir session.  If a doctor's office can ask this question, surely it's easy for a photography studio to ask!  The female photographer there that day (only one), was alright, but she really isn't well versed at photographing girls that are not on the skinny supermodel side of the size spectrum in a flattering light.  The male photographer that I had was annoying.  He asked inappropriate questions (like asking if my friend wanted to have children), and attempted to get me into poses that were uncomfortable.  I had to draw the line at a pose that would have had my breasts falling completely out of my outfit, the angle and pose was so unnatural.\n\nThe poses are all manufactured and the same for everyone.  Some of them are awkward and unnatural, leaving the person looking uncomfortable and maybe a little scared they're going to fall.  No wonder a lot of the terrible Glamour Shots poses from the 90's had people looking absolutely terrified.\n\nThe makeup is not tailored to each person.  They used the same neutral palette on both of us, and it's a normal 4 shades of brown application that one would do for a smoky eye.  When asked what we wanted for hair, I'm not sure what my friend said, but I know I said I was looking for a pin up, vintage style.  It was a side part with curls.  That's it.  Everyone got a side part with curls, so I suppose everyone was going for a pin up, vintage style that wasn't actually pin up or vintage?\n\nThe $450 value assigned to the groupon was bullshit.  No one would pay $300 for that dvd slideshow.  It's set to crappy music, the Glamour Shots logo is all over the photos (distractingly so), and it includes their \""retouched photos\"" which look overly processed and filtered.  Seriously, learn photoshop people!  I'm 30, I don't need to look 12 with you erasing all of my laugh lines and smoothing out my skin so I look like a Botoxed Barbie.  I would have gladly traded the dvd slideshow for more prints, but that was not an option.\n\nI did not spend any extra money there because I was so disappointed in the entire experience.  The only reason that we'll be back is to pick up our pictures, but after that, not again.  We were there for nearly 7 hours, which is an obscene amount of time to spend in a place that isn't your job.","Rate the following statement ""very negative"", ""negative"", ""neutral"", ""positive"", or ""very positive"".

I'm far from my early 20's when I used to add a raw egg or 2 to my daily whey protein & creatine shake, or eat 6 hard boiled eggs daily to help 'bulk up'...but I still love me some eggs early in the morning!\n\nThe Cracked Egg if you can't already tell is a breakfast-heavy joint.  They are usually only open daily for breakfast and lunch.  It's been voted 'The Best of Las Vegas' by the LVRJ at least 3 times.  So I figure instead of making my own breakfast we'd go check this place out.  \n\nThe day we went it was packed!  Of course, it was a Sunday and church was probably just letting out.  There's a big hustle and bustle here, no shortage of orders being called out, waitstaff running around with plates, and the smell of fresh coffee being brewed.  Man, do I love the first meal of the day!  Yes, I am a morning person.  Night owls beware!\n\nMenu is a good size and offers a ton of choices.  Now with The Cracked Egg being its namesake, please realize that most of their dishes require EGGS.  If you don't like eggs or egg products STEER CLEAR.  Should be obvious.  Go back to your overpriced lattes and friggin' scones.  Go dunk your donuts somewhere else.  Go back to your toaster to watch those tarts pop.  I feel sad for you folks.\n\nThe Cracked Egg has different parts to their menu.  There's \""Breanne's Basics\"" which  have your plain eggs & bacon, eggs & sausage, and similar type stuff here.  In \""Eggs With Attitude\"" these dishes are mostly various things scrambled with eggs, which they call a 'scramble'.  I much enjoy the Southwest Scramble which has 3 eggs scrambled with chorizo, green chiles, jalapenos, onion, jack & cheddar cheese, and a side of salsa.  \""The Benedicts\"" is self-explanatory, a list of all their different Eggs Benedict concoctions.  Me?  I like the good ol' regular Eggs Benedict standard, done right.  In the \""Fluffy & Folded\"" section you got your 3 egg omelettes, and my faves are The Denver with ham, bell peppers, onions, and cheese, or The Greek with spinach, tomatoes, and feta.  Yum!  \""Sin City Skillets\"" are for you wannabe cowboys who like your food coming in a cast-iron skillet, build your own or choose one off of their menu.  The last big breakfast section is \""From the Griddle\"" and includes their French toast choices as well as fresh pancakes.  From what I've tried and what I've heard...it's all pretty good stuff.  \n\nThe Cracked Egg also has non-breakfast stuff for you non-breakfast eaters too.  From sandwiches and salads, to burgers and homemade chili, it's all there.  But why come to a breakfast joint and not have breakfast?  It's like going to El Pollo Loco and asking for fish!  Try the breakfast.\n\nOnly gripe I have here is that the prices are a bit on the high side.  I could make some of these dishes at home easily for half the cost, and do just as good a job since I love making breakfast anyway.  Two folks eating breakfast with a cup of joe each will probably set you back $25+ after tax and tip depending on what you eat.  Worth it if you go every once in a while or on a special occasion.

The last big breakfast section is \""From the Griddle\"" and includes their French toast choices as well as fresh pancakes.  From what I've tried and what I've heard...it's all pretty good stuff.  \n\nThe Cracked Egg also has non-breakfast stuff for you non-breakfast eaters too.  From sandwiches and salads, to burgers and homemade chili, it's all there.  But why come to a breakfast joint and not have breakfast?  It's like going to El Pollo Loco and asking for fish!  Try the breakfast.\n\nOnly gripe I have here is that the prices are a bit on the high side.  I could make some of these dishes at home easily for half the cost, and do just as good a job since I love making breakfast anyway.  Two folks eating breakfast with a cup of joe each will probably set you back $25+ after tax and tip depending on what you eat.  Worth it if you go every once in a while or on a special occasion.  Or if you're loaded like Steve Wynn.  Geez, that guy is rich.\n\nStop by The Cracked Egg, have a hearty breakfast, then bench press that little Fiat in the parking lot!

0,"I'm giving this place one star and that's only because of the location.  The restaurant is situated in the Old Port of Montreal, on a beautiful cobblestone street, tons of charm...that's where the positive part of this review ends.\n\nWe were greeted as we entered the restaurant and were seated quickly.  However, it took almost 20 minutes to get a glass of water, another 25 minutes to get our beer, which we ordered once our water was delivered.  When our extremely stressed, profusely sweating and almost invisible waiter did finally bring us our beer, in bottles, he asked us if we wanted a glass and if we did that we could go ahead and use our wine glasses, which we weren't using.\n\nAbout an hour after being seated, and 40 minutes after ordering our food, we still did not receive a morsel of food.  We noticed that the waiter had been bringing baskets of warm bread to the tables earlier, so I asked if it would be possible to get some bread while we waited for our food.  The waiter explained that 1) they were out of bread and were waiting for more to be delivered and 2) that even if they had bread that the oven was being used for something else and our bread would be cold.  He explained that we were \""first\"" on his list for bread once they got more bread.  About 20 minutes later, he brought us bread...it was cold, along with the butter.  My friend decided to heat the butter by holding it over the candle flame, which could have worked brilliantly, only the plastic packaging began to melt, so cold butter is what we settled for.  \n\nSalad was included with my meal, but not my friend's, so he ordered a salad in addition to his meal.  The salads arrived about an hour after we placed our order (yes, AN HOUR FOR SALAD).  \n\nWe did finally receive our food, I had ordered the salmon with shrimp sauce and my friend had ordered the whitefish.  The portion sizes were large enough, but my salmon was extremely fatty and the shrimp had not been deveined, and my friend's fish was riddled with bones, we counted at least 30 of them.   Both dishes were served with rice and overcooked vegetables (rappini and zuchini).  We asked our waiter to bring us some lemon wedges, but he forgot, so we asked the hostess and she went to the bar and got us some (of course this was almost 15 minutes after we had been served the fish).\n\nThe waiter did not once ask us how our meals were, nor did he ask us if we wanted another drink after we finished our beer.  We had to flag down the hostess for everything.  \n\nI'd like to point out that the restaurant was by no means busy, and we were not alone in our assessment.  We watched a table of 7 people gulp down their green soup, and then wait for well over an hour before receiving their mains, and only half the table got their mains, the rest had to wait an additional 10 minutes.  \n\nOur meals (salad and fish) along with 3 beers total over $85.  I have to say that paying that bill felt like wallet rape.\n\nAll in all, this place was a disaster and I would not return, and I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone.","Rate the following statement ""very negative"", ""negative"", ""neutral"", ""positive"", or ""very positive"".

We noticed that the waiter had been bringing baskets of warm bread to the tables earlier, so I asked if it would be possible to get some bread while we waited for our food.  The waiter explained that 1) they were out of bread and were waiting for more to be delivered and 2) that even if they had bread that the oven was being used for something else and our bread would be cold.  He explained that we were \""first\"" on his list for bread once they got more bread.  About 20 minutes later, he brought us bread...it was cold, along with the butter.  My friend decided to heat the butter by holding it over the candle flame, which could have worked brilliantly, only the plastic packaging began to melt, so cold butter is what we settled for.  \n\nSalad was included with my meal, but not my friend's, so he ordered a salad in addition to his meal.  The salads arrived about an hour after we placed our order (yes, AN HOUR FOR SALAD).  \n\nWe did finally receive our food, I had ordered the salmon with shrimp sauce and my friend had ordered the whitefish.  The portion sizes were large enough, but my salmon was extremely fatty and the shrimp had not been deveined, and my friend's fish was riddled with bones, we counted at least 30 of them.   Both dishes were served with rice and overcooked vegetables (rappini and zuchini).  We asked our waiter to bring us some lemon wedges, but he forgot, so we asked the hostess and she went to the bar and got us some (of course this was almost 15 minutes after we had been served the fish).\n\nThe waiter did not once ask us how our meals were, nor did he ask us if we wanted another drink after we finished our beer.  We had to flag down the hostess for everything.  \n\nI'd like to point out that the restaurant was by no means busy, and we were not alone in our assessment.  We watched a table of 7 people gulp down their green soup, and then wait for well over an hour before receiving their mains, and only half the table got their mains, the rest had to wait an additional 10 minutes.  \n\nOur meals (salad and fish) along with 3 beers total over $85.  I have to say that paying that bill felt like wallet rape.\n\nAll in all, this place was a disaster and I would not return, and I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

0,"I went here excited by the prospect of mixing alcohol and ice cream, the perfect combo!  We braved the downtown Scottsdale crowds and lack of parking on a Saturday night just so we could try the ice cream here.

Being that he is among the top DJ's on the planet, we figured it would be packed so, of course, I turn to my fellow Yelpsters for advice...\nLet me confirm and clear up a few things now that I have been there. \nFirst the nerve-wrecking stairs, this is a 5 story spot, but the club is only 3 stories. You enter on the main floor, so if you are there for EDM, stay there and no stairs. The main floor is the middle, so if you are there for hip-hop go downstairs, and now I can see a problem.\nSecond the non-VIP seating policy, there actually are places to sit for non-VIP. If you go downstairs, damn stairs!, you have two directions at the bottom, straight in the main room or do a 180 and walk down the hall. The back room is open seating, at least until the promoters sell the seat as VIP, but to us it seamed like we had a place to sit all night. Plus those bartenders are way less busy and hoooook it up!\nThird the nice staff, this one is true! These were without a doubt the nicest bouncers and bartenders we had ever dealt with, and we have been to clubs from SF to Ibiza. It was a much better feel than the normal steroid-staredown that you get from most clubs in Vegas. \nFourth the dress code, this is normal for Vegas, smart casual. A previous post mentions flip-flops, I did not see any, but let's face it a dress code is 99.9% for the guys so maybe she did sneak in with them on...\nFifth the music in the hip hop room, the posts about the gangster rap are probably from people that did not stay down there long enough, we really felt there was a good mix of many genres of hip hop, but we were there for Tiesto!\nLast the dance floor, prior posts are accurate, there is little to no dance floor for a club that holds 5000 people. The main dance floors get so packed that it becomes more of a collective fist pump rather than dancing. We found that upstairs was the better place to dance. There is an open area up there, and while not technically a dance floor, we sure turned it into one! Oh and you can see the DJ booth from up there, if you look through the VIP's lining the rail. \nThe lack of dance floor space is the reason I knocked a star off.

I asked another server to let my waitress know I needed my check  but saw she had been seated a second table.  So I waited.  Then I got up and went to the kitchen door.  The other waiter came thru and said do you want to start tomorrow jokingly :) and then said she didn't come over yet??? and I said no.  So I go back to my table.

Check out their fb for times and events of movies and tv shows. I know they show the walking dead weekly when it's airing on the network.\n\nOh and don't forget to grab a bag of popcron while you have a cold one.

First of all my son was sick and throwing up, his fever was over 103.9, his breathing was not normal. we waited for over 25 min in the room but no one was in the waiting room. I told the PA Joseph that this was not normal as I am his mother and know how he is on a day to day basis. The PA asked me if he was pulling on his ears, I said no I know when my son has an ear infection because he has had them before. He checks his ears and say wow your right no ear infection. Then he persists on trying to look in my sons mouth, keep in mind he is 16 months old. That is not an easy task but he has me lay him down to then harm him by forcing a stick in his mouth. At this point I am beyond upset with this PA. He then tells me well their is nothing we can do for him. As a wife to a fireman I naturally call my husband because this wasn't right. I asked for zofran to help with the nausea and vomitting, the PA wouldn't give me anything. He said we will call this fever with nausea, and for me to go to the ER on new years eve if it gets worse.

0,"This school is an abysmal daycare masquerading as a qualified preschool. I had my daughter at Top of the Classs for about a month and a half before pulling her out due to rude staff and the poor quality education she was receiving. I am absolutely shocked that this place is in business. I can concur with another Yelper about the front doors constantly being left open which is extremely concerning. On top of the lack of security, I'm not sure any of the teachers have any formal education or teaching credentials. Miss Melanie the supervisor/manager is extremely brusk and rude. If she was working the front desk she would NEVER greet my daughter or me at drop offs or pickups. She would make eye contact and look back down at her phone or paperwork. The center is outdated and I witnessed large groups of children eating snacks and lunches on the floor in the hallway. There were older children (8-10 year old's) running around the younger pre-k children completely unsupervised.

Statement: This school is an abysmal daycare masquerading as a qualified preschool. I had my daughter at Top of the Classs for about a month and a half before pulling her out due to rude staff and the poor quality education she was receiving. I am absolutely shocked that this place is in business. I can concur with another Yelper about the front doors constantly being left open which is extremely concerning. On top of the lack of security, I'm not sure any of the teachers have any formal education or teaching credentials. Miss Melanie the supervisor/manager is extremely brusk and rude. If she was working the front desk she would NEVER greet my daughter or me at drop offs or pickups. She would make eye contact and look back down at her phone or paperwork. The center is outdated and I witnessed large groups of children eating snacks and lunches on the floor in the hallway. There were older children (8-10 year old's) running around the younger pre-k children completely unsupervised. My daughter learned some EXTREMELY inappropriate things and constantly complained about older kids picking  on her and calling her names. My daughter is well adjusted and has never had issues. I made a huge mistake by ever introducing this school into her life. \n\nThere are some wonderful primary schools and preschools in the Valley. Unfortunately, Top of the Class isn't one of them.

0,"Club Tempo has started a new weekly event called Jazzy Sundays. Doors open at 8pm where they have complimentary stepping classes. Afterward ,they have a live band. The format is creative and allows for a bit of variety. However, unfortunately, as is the case with a few minority owned establishments, things are not what they first appear to be.  \n\nThe first negative: They sell alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages but no food. In my opinion, an establishment catering themselves to adults over the age of 30 should be able to provide more than simply alcoholic beverages; from an entertainment and safety standpoint. Tempo does bring out a selection of 4 hot food choices around 9:30, which they liberally term a buffet. Perhaps this is their attempt to compensate for their lack of a kitchen.  The food does not stick around long and lasts for about 30 minutes before it is eaten depending on the number of attendees that evening. \n\n2nd, in order to use a credit card one has to spend over $20. They have an ATM machine you can use that will gladly charge you a service fee if you don't carry cash around like most business professionals. \n\n3rd, the most important criteria I have when patronizing an establishment is the quality of their customer service. This is where Tempo severely under-shines.  They underwhelm in making sure their guests are comfortable. The use of polite terms like excuse me, i apologize, sir or what have you appears to be a foreign concept.  Tempo caters toward bothers and sisters and are owned by brothers. You would think they would provide equivalent or better hospitality than their caucasion/white counterparts? This is not the case. Tempo is one of those establishments were they feel they are doing you a favor, when in realty they are providing a service. Bad news travels much further than good news and Tempo's ownership would be best served by taking heed of this.\n\nIn summary, there are much better and friendly establishments to frequent than tempo.","Rate the following statement ""very negative"", ""negative"", ""neutral"", ""positive"", or ""very positive"".

0,"I liked, but did not love, La Reve.\n\nAs others have mentioned though, that is probably because I had seen several Cirque shows before, both in Vegas and on tour.  \n\nLa Reve is pretty to look at and very well done... and there are elements that I truly enjoyed but it just didn't hold my attention the entire time like a Cirque show can. \n\nWhat I did like was the somewhat dark and mysterious nature of the show in spots.  The opening with the craggy, industrial looking tree and the acrobatics that take place on it, is fantastic to watch.  \n\nAlso the section with the angels (though some people have said \""doves\"" but my first thought was angels) reminded me of what I would think an angel would look like.  Not that I am particularly religious, I'm not... I just don't buy into sweet and gentle nature of angels that is so commonplace.  With that in mind, that particular part of the show was kind of like a Revelations type descent from heaven come to life, for me.  It was pretty breathtaking.  \n\nAside from that, because I am a dancer I love watching choreography of all forms and I love the demonstration of the human body and what it's capable of.  These performers are so strong, and so well rehearsed... it's really quite awesome.\n\nWould I go back and see it again?  No.   There really isn't a bad seat in the house, and it was worth my time..

Get there 10 minutes later and all of the sudden it's a 35 minute wait. We let them know we had 3 kids and needed a highchair, but they sat us at a table where we couldn't have a highchair. The hostess went to see if she could find a table and after a few minutes took us to a new table. Once there, are drink order was taken, appetizer were ordered, and then it was 15 minutes before the waitress came back take our order. When appetizer arrived one had to be sent back and took forever to get back. Then we waited for 30 minutes after the appetizers were killed before our food arrived. The kids orders were wrong, but they were starving at this point and didn't care. One of the adult meals was wrong also and when we asked the guy who brought them out to take it back he got really annoyed and glared at my friend.

0,"The Skinny: Nice hotel, great place to stay even though there isn't much to do other than go to the spa, stay by the pool, eat or gamble - but there's nothing wrong with that(4.5).\n\nWe stayed here for two weekday nights in August for a brief staycation. Check-in service was painless albeit it was a weekend day afternoon and not very busy.\n\nWe were really impressed by the ambience of the hotel room (resort room with a view of the Strip). The modern decor matched our tastes. There was a flat screen tv with a Bose wave sound clock radio.  The bed, covered with plush pillows and fresh linens, was comfortable. The bathroom was great - two vanity sinks with an integrated tv (which had bad reception), enclosed granite shower, a bathtub with a view of the Strip (and a electronic privacy shade if you desire). Complementary cards were included in the suite. Maid service was excellent.\n\nUse of the fitness area costs $15 and internet costs $13/day which seemed rather pricey to me. I'll post a pic of the spa prices (note: they charge you a mandatory 20% gratuity!).\n\nThe amenities include use of the pool area which was lovely. We enjoyed lazing around the pool all afternoon like two slugs. It was awesome! The crowd there is diverse - you see kids in their lifejackets, the elderly sunning next to their wheelchairs and the young 20 somethings sporting designer shades and swimwear. The music is top 20's with some pop favourites from the 80's. Fortunately, the music was at a comfortable decibel level.\n\nThe casino itself was quiet during our weekday vacay and was relatively smoke free for a casino. Also really like they didn't pump some yucky perfume in the ventilation system like other casinos on the Strip. Loved the free beverage fountain next to Marinelli's which wasn't watered down! (they had Fresca! I love Fresca!)\n\nDisadvantages: well, if you don't gamble, go to the spa, lounge in the pool or check out Tina Martini- there isn't much here to do unlike other local casinos which have movie theatres and bowling alleys. \n\nThe location is another factor to consider because there really isn't much around the casino - plus it's far from the Strip for visitors. You'll definitely need a car if you stay here.\n\nFinally, the food doesn't quite live up to level of quality at the hotel. Compared to other Strip casino hotels which have great restaurants there or nearby, this hotel's food is okay but not great.\n\nOverall, a really nice stay and we were glad we came to relax here.

I was visiting AZ last weekend, friends suggested I go here since its a new place in old town. Got there around 8.30 and after 25 mins of looking for table we found one. It took another 20 for someone to take our order (we ordered food & drinks). As we waited for our food  the rude bouncers came and asked us to get up and move to the next table, we did, then a few minutes later, they told us they needed the chairs we were sitting on, and they took those as well. At this point our table had been pushed completely In front of a hugeee fan, & we had no chairs. While standing around like fools & telling the bouncer had food coming,the bouncer said he would get us chairs & turn the fan off- it never happened. The next part is what ticked me off- the server brought our food and placed it right in front of the fan, allowing dirt & dust\nTo be blown on it, not to mention the cheese on my pizza coagulated within seconds. 10 mins after the food was just laying around .

And as usual I play music via their touch tunes. I always play a good mix rap, rock, country and of course some good ole Mexican music ie Selena and Elvis Crespo. Nothing crazy like I said a good mix of music and no one has ever complained. Well today I played a nice popular Selena song and about halfway in the owner Ed walks over to me (obviously the only Hispanic customer there) and asks me if I had picked this song. Awkward I go well yes I did why is there a problem. Ed tells me well I just wanted to make sure someone paid for this and it is not a random song, usually we skip music like this. As my jaw drops I ask why. Well Mr. Donald Sterling tells me well it's early in the morning and I don't want people to get uncomfortable  it's almost like playing hardcore rap music with a bunch of F bombs no one wants to hear that. Whoa whoa whoa it's an open juke box and if you don't want certain types of music played then block it. Simple as that. So I tell him to give me my money back and he can skip the song. Ed tells me no that's ok he will let me play my song this time. And I could already see who had complained as an older woman and her maybe mother or friend had a sour look on their face as they were staring at me. Well my response to all of that was hello you are at a bar before noon and there are no listed guidelines on what music to play. So I will take my money somewhere else where my brownness will not offend anyone.

0,I enjoy the patio dining here. The mountain view is beautiful when the sun is going down which is about the time happy hour is winding down as well. The same waiter (I didn't get his name) has served my table several times and he is topnotch. It's a good place to have a drink and relax.\n\nI like the green rice and boiled whole pinto beans. It's a lighter option to the standard sides of beans and rice offered at most Mexican restaurants. I don't usually order appetizers here. The entree portions are large and they bring out some really yummy chips and salsa to start making the apps unnecessary. The fajitas are large enough to share or take home and reheat for lunch the next day. They offer a nice selection of Mexican beers on tap. Which I like because I prefer draft to bottled brew.,"Rate the following statement ""very negative"", ""negative"", ""neutral"", ""positive"", or ""very positive"".

0,"Yoli's has recently been popping up on Yelp's 'Best Of' front page.

It seemed that the place had be 5-stars for a while but trending analysis showed a decline in the late 2011- early 2012. Alright enough nerd talk-  it was a Saturday morning, I was starving and I needed a place to have brunch with my lady friend in town.\n\nWhen it comes to brunch at Yoli's, you really need to leave all your expectations at the door. The neighborhood its in is a little sub-par, the parking situation isn't grand and the interior and patio decor resembles a home that stopped paying for landscaping services a long time ago. The tables outside are all basic basic plastic, they are not squeaky clean (or perfectly leveled) and the seating is pretty limited. If you are coming to Yoli's, you are coming here for the food and nothing else, this ain't no brunch at the Four Seasons.\n\nTheir menus are strictly breakfast/brunch related but at a 2-sided page list, their breakfast choices do have a large variety of flavors and prices. The food is on the stealthier side with skillet dishes, omelets and diner-style potato sides. My friend and I ordered their most popular dish, the El Monte- Hawaiian french toast sandwich filled with egg whites, turkey, bacon and cheese with a 'spicy orange marmalade'. At about $7, the sandwich was pretty large and filled me up easily after just half of it. The french toast itself was soft and spongy and the bacon had some crisp, but the turkey was very thinly-sliced deli meat so it didn't have a lot of flavor and the spicy marmalade was tasty but not spicy at all.\n\nThe service was a tad slow but the lady was very very courteous and nice to us, she just didn't stop by very often so we had to wait around for our drinks and our check for quite a while.

0,"We stayed at the Silverton Casino 5-17 to 5-19-13. What a gem! He had just stayed 5 nights in the Penthouse Suite at The Mirage, so while the room was quite different than we were used to, it was very clean, comfortable, and quite large for a typical hotel room. We paid $59/night for a Fri-Sat stay, which is far less than you could get for a similar room on the Strip. \n\nThe room was very nicely decorated in Earth tones. Our room had a very comfortable king sized bed, two night stands, a love seat in a small sitting area, dining table, and a television armoire. They haven't yet upgraded to flat screen televisions in the Deluxe King rooms, but we didn't spend any time in the room watching television anyway. There is a safe located inside the television armoire, which is very small, but suitable for cameras and small electronic equipment. \nAir conditioning worked very well, although the unit itself was somewhat noisy. This actually turned out to be a plus, as the night we arrived they were having a Zumba dance party by the pool, and listening to the air conditioner was more pleasant than the horrid music pumping out during the marathon exercise session\n. \nThe bathroom is small, but perfectly adequate. The biggest complaint was that the shower head was too low for my 6'3\"" sweetie. Otherwise, the bathroom was stocked with plenty of towels along with Bath and Body Works products. Hot water was plentiful and the water pressure was great.\n\nThe casino itself is awesome. Very large, plenty of slot machines and table games are available. The Silverton Rewards club provides great benefits, and we both received a pass to Seasons Buffet once we earned 50 points on the Rewards Card (which took all of about 20 minutes to earn). We are both non-smokers, and neither of us had any complaints about excessive smoke in the casino. In fact, the only time I ever noticed smoke was if a smoker sat down next to me. Wait staff in the casino was FAR superior to any of the casinos we played at on the Strip.\n\nThe restaurants at Silverton are fabulous. We ate at nearly every single restaurant on property and enjoyed them all. I wouldn't say that Seasons was the greatest buffet in the world, but it was clean, food was well stocked, and our waiter was right on top of everything. Mi Casa Cantina serves up excellent Mexican food at a very reasonable price. The Sundance Grill is open 24 hours and provides casual dining with late night food specials. We ate breakfast here; it was tasty and very budget friendly. Johnny Rockets is also located on the casino floor, but we did not eat here on this trip. The flagship of the Silverton dining experience is Twin Creeks- which is an absolute must-visit during your trip. It has a beautifully romantic ambiance, and serves upscale steakhouse fare at prices much lower than similar restaurants on the Strip. The Tomahawk Rib Eye was simply divine! I just can't say enough about this incredible restaurant and the amazing staff.\nThe Silverton is connected to a Bass Pro Shop. If you are into that kind of thing, this store is huge and gorgeous. We went in and walked around, but didn't buy anything. Neither one of us are into outdoor sports, so I can't comment on whether or not the place is overpriced.\n\nThe best thing about the Silverton is the overall atmosphere and service level. The staff members were all very accommodating, helpful, and extremely friendly. We didn't have a bad experience with a single staff member on property, and we went everywhere. Upon our arrival at around 11am, we had practically no wait for service, and the front desk clerk had no problem giving us an early check in time. All the housekeeping staff made sure to say hello anytime they walked by, and all of the wait staff members in the restaurants were attentive and friendly. The casino caters to a slightly older clientele with some locals, and since there isn't a nightclub on property, there is very little pretentiousness among the guests. Everyone we ran into was relaxed and polite. And then there is the convenience factor; everything at the hotel/casino is within a 5 minute walk from your room, and the hotel is all of 10 minutes away from the Strip. Free shuttle service runs from the hotel to the airport, and to Caesar's Palace on the Strip if you don't have a car. \n\nIf it sounds like I'm gushing upon the Silverton, it's because I am. This was my first trip to Vegas, and my first off-strip hotel. I must say I was highly impressed, and we will definitely be making return trips to this fabulous little hotel in the future.","Rate the following statement ""very negative"", ""negative"", ""neutral"", ""positive"", or ""very positive"".

0,"Was here for a convention.  The bathrooms in the convention area were spacious and clean.  However, the lunch breaks offered very little for the people with any dietary restrictions.  Even my local sandwich shop in Austin TX can make me a sandwich with gluten free bread.....not so much in Vegas.  I ate salads for lunch and eggs/bacon for supper mostly as I was too tired to find a good restaurant with a chef that can do gluten free/dairy free.  Thought the gambling area smelled like smoke, so I didn't do any gambling there.  Since my only other experiences in Vegas are either at the Bellagio or Mandalay Bay, the Mirage is average at best IMHO.\n\nUpdate later that same year:  Girls weekend in Vegas for 4 ppl.  Reservations made all together on one credit card and one name so they are linked together.  Requested adjoining/connecting rooms as this was a girls weekend.  When we arrived the reservations were NOT linked.  They did not have us in adjoining or connecting rooms.  They did NOT alter that fact, nor did they seem to care that this was inconvenient or a problem.  They did not address it or offer any compensation for this HUGE inconvenience.  It really affected the trip that if two of us went up and were not the two sharing the same room, then we either had to be apart or cart items between the rooms...same goes for sharing accessories, having morning coffee, etc.  It was just a drag.  The Mirage was seemingly unaware of how girls weekends operate.  Their attitude was uncaring and I will NEVER go back.  Why make a reservation for two rooms in advance if the reservation itself is not honored?  Why pay a reservation hold fee if it isn't holding what you want?  Why go out of town for a girls weekend, if you can't spend the weekend with the girls?  We did have fun, but the inconvenience was a bit dampening.  If you expect good customer service go to the Bellagio, if you want clean rooms and no service, then stay here.","Rate the following statement ""very negative"", ""negative"", ""neutral"", ""positive"", or ""very positive"".

0,"With great bagel sandwich names and wonderful combinations, Owen's Bagels is a solid locale to grab breakfast and/or lunch. The menu can be a bit overwhelming, so they have it narrowed down by the type of meat involved (which is helpful for folks who only eat certain meats). And if you go on the weekend, be prepared for a line and a bit of a wait due to the popularity of this trendy little joint. \n\nI've tried the following:\n\n1. The Muenster Mash on a whole wheat bagel - Hummus, Muenster, Green Peppers, Onion, Lettuce, and Tomato. Seriously good. My favorite bagel at Owen's. No need for meat when you have all this delicious veggieness on one homemade bagel. And at only $4.00, this is a steal.\n\n2. Sir Purr's Purrfect Bagel on whole wheat - Turkey, Veggie Cream Cheese, Smoked Cheddar, Lettuce, Tomato. I never thought I'd say this, but there was WAY too much cheese on this thing. Not sure if the maker of the sandwich was just heavy-handed with the veggie cream cheese or what, but I had to scrape a bunch of it off before I could even eat the sandwich. After that it was very good. A bit more expensive at $5.65.\n\n3. Cinnamon Raisin Bagel with Maple Nut Cream Cheese - I do not recommend this option. The bagel barely had any raisins in it and wasn't really very cinnamon-y, either. And the maple nut cream cheese was disgusting. Go for one of the sandwiches and you'll be much happier with your experience.\n\nBe sure to bring your appetite as the bagel sammies are quite large. And take some time to read all the funny little quips written on the walls - or write some for yourself - either way you'll be entertained. Owens is located in South End across from the Atherton Mills Market. So swing in for a bagel sammie and then run across the street for some healthy fruits and veggies.

Judgement 1 star!!\n\nThe other saving grace of the evening was the drinks, 1 pitcher of sangria helped to wash my mouth out and the braqndy coffee was as good as ive had.\n\nAll in all not a good experience, I have heard this is a poor recreation of their Glasgow restaurant. My tip to them would be either improve or LEAVE!!!\n\nJd = not happy man!

Before I left, I told the hostess to put it back the way it was. \n\nI plan to actually have a meal there sometime and then post a proper review... until then, this will have to do.

This place is close to my work so I'm here at least twice a week for cheap produce and reasonably priced meats.  The selection is still great, and I've noticed over the months that more and more non-Latinos shop here!  Good job people!  Cheapy like me!  Their produce prices sure beat the local Albertson's and Vons and Smith's by a long shot.  The only other place I get veggies is the Asian market but that's only because those yummy types of veggies aren't found here at Cardenas.  Go ahead, ask the stocker where they keep the baby bok choy and the fragrant pears!  You will get a look of confusion.  Well, that could also be because the stocker doesn't understand English very well.  In either case, you're out of luck.\n\nCardenas is still mostly one stop shop for your Mexican needs.  Besides the large supermarket area, you still have your juice bar, bakery, deli, and tortilleria stations within the store.  The tortillas here are pretty good, I'm spoiled now...I only buy fresh made corn tortillas from the tortilleria for my tacos!  They taste 100 times better when they are made only a few hours ago.  Really makes a difference in your Mexican dishes.\n\nThe juice bar is tasty, with fresh concoctions of strawberry and watermelon juices, or a fresh fruit smoothie.  It's better if you know a bit of Spanish because the drink orders can get confusing.  Got what I thought was supposed to be a strawberry smoothie, but they for some reason added beets!  Tastier than I thought it would be but still, could have done without them.\n\nCardenas bakery goes all day long.  When you enter the store you constantly smell the aroma of fresh bread or pastries coming out of the oven.  Tip, always ask for the freshest stuff out of the ovens (usually will be on trays where the ovens are).  I find that sometimes the pastries in the case can be sitting there for a while, and Lord knows who's been touching them or who's kids boogie face got on them.  A sign that says 'Please use tongs' doesn't always fit the bill!\n\nI am often here for a quick lunch at the Cardenas deli, especially when they run their weekly specials.  $5 sale for a burrito al pastor?  $3 for a ham torta?  Often with a free drink?  I'm there!  I enjoy most of the fare at Cardenas, and it's great they have a free salsa bar to partake with each meal.  As of late, they have taken out the sliced cucumbers and sliced radishes that used to be regulars at the bar...but it's ok.  They probably had to because of food cost, or because of people like me who love to stock up for some healthy snacking!  No problem though, looks like more pickled jalapenos for me!  I am probably there for food at least 5-6 times a month.  I love me a torta with a mix of tomatillo salsa and Cardenas hot sauce for dipping.  MUY DELICIOSO!\n\nCheap and easy, that's my motto.

We asked for them to omit some spicy tuna from one of their specialty rolls and he gave us so much attitude about it we almost left.\n\nI was back in town again this week and gave RA another try for dinner with a group of 5.  First  of all, it is WAY too loud in there.  The music is turned up so high, we had to scream at each other just to have a conversation.  As soon as we sat down, they turned the lights down so low we could not read the menus.  Luckily, we are A/V techs working in town and we all had our flashlights handy.   You would think seeing a table full of flashlights would clue them in to turn the lights up again, but no such luck.\n\nWe had already been waiting quite a while when our waitress came and asked us if we would mind waiting some more so she could finish with another table.  When she finally got our table going, our beers were served warm (it was 110 degrees outside) and we had to ask for glasses for them.  When she took the food order, she couldn't hear one end of the table. After shouting back and forth with bad results, we had to suggest she come around to the other end of the table so she could hear us better.  The worst part came when the entire group had been served, except for one of us.  When we inquired about this she said - and this is verbatim - 'If we waited to bring it out until it was all ready, the fish would go bad'.  We also received our appetizer AFTER we had finished our meal, with no apology or explanation. \n\nIf the food was amazing I would say putting up with all this was tolerable, but it just isn't.  The servings are skimpy and there is more rice than anything else in most rolls.  Their specialty rolls are not even served with wasabi or ginger.  The failed mexi-japanese fusion menu is more flash than fish.  \n\nI sincerely hope the owners and management have more experience expediting a kitchen than our experience indicated, or that the waitress seemed to be aware of.

Leaving no space to stand or dance or wait for a drink.  The second floor outside area, didn't get any better. For the 20 minutes we were there before we decided to leave, it was like we were walking in narrow hallways of VIP rope. I felt so upset paying cover and not even being here for half an hour and  enjoying the place. How does crappy place get this thinking they can charge the same cover as a much better, bigger Vegas club like XS?  I'll refuse to come here again and warn my friends about it.

0,"Location: hidden in a small complex near a salon, subway, and next door to Bachi Burger. \n\nAfter our party was waiting for what seemed an eternity at Bachi Burger, we decided to go to its sister place, Ramen Shoku.  Simply put, I most likely, not probably, won't be back here again. The various appetizers including the GYOZA and TAKOYAKI was somewhat interesting, but nothing too exciting to do an order of again.  Each of us  had something different...TONKOTSU, SPICY MISO, and I had the most touted TAN TAN MEN ramen for 11.50.  It was overly salty and the noodles were too al dente.  I couldn't get past the overly salty taste of the soup and it seemed that every time I had the soup, I would be grappling for the water as a chaser.  The menu stated spciy base, but they need to edit it and put salty base.  I almost wanted to add the carafe of water into the soup and ask them to heat the soup along with the al dente noodles to cook some more.  The overpowering taste of salt definitely made me want to walk out that door and not even consider ramen places in general.  I think the SPICY RAMEN was more up my alley as it had more flavor from the miso base.  The base of the TAN TAN MEN was just simply oxtail soup which would have been more preferable than what they had added to it.  It definitely helped me to eat less, but then again helped me to cross this off my list or put it on my list of places to never go back again.  \n\nNext time, I'll wait for Bachi Burger even if it's an hour long wait...there's a reason why this place was barely empty and the Bachi was filled to the brim.

It is possible that for the purposes of routine shots and other 40$ treatments/procedures/matters, this animal hospital is perfectly fine.

It was like a bad SNL skit (think Will Ferrell as a doctor). \n\nThey charged an extra 5$ for the CD that the xray results were placed in. \n\nIn the end, the poor cat was just constipated.

This new location is far, far off the Strip and requires a long drive to get there. Back parking lot is a hike to the front.\n - Cost. Everything costs so much - extra for parking, extra for tube rental, expensive locker rental, extra expense for line-jumping pass, extremely costly charge ($150) for cabana rental. This is on top of the hefty $40 per adult charge.\n - Changing Rooms. Little to no clothes changing stalls in both male and female bathrooms; very few showers.\n - Entry. Entrances to the wave pool and lazy river are narrow and cause congestion\n - Tubes. You have to haul your own float tube to the top of the rides - no conveyor belt to assist in getting the tube to the top\n - Wait time - longish lines (without the line jump band) meant a long wait between fun rides.\n - Special salt water conditioning system in pools is harsh on swim suits - my daughter's dark pink suit came home very light pink\n\nTip:\n* Take your own shade and chairs - those are in short supply\n* Be sure to wear flip-flops or watershoes to all the rides - there is a LOT of non-shaded cement and it gets very hot.

Gather around kids and let Uncle Rex tell you a story...when Rex was a small child he spent many a month on the East Coast. It was a magical time.  My father, who beat young Rex mercilessly if Rex called him anything but \""The Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora\"", was originally from the Northeast.  My father was an odd man, a brutal man, a man with big dreams and small child like hands.  On my fifth birthday he brought Rex with him as he knocked over a 7-11.  As Rex helped him tie up the store clerk he let me pick any one thing Rex wanted in the store.  Young Rex wandered around the store, trying very hard to not step in the pools of blood, Rex saw the object he wanted...Rex turned and said \""Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora can Rex have THAT?\""  He nodded.  Rex kicked the 87 year old man laying on some of it...and picked it up. It was a bag with a delicious cheesesteak in it.  Rex danced. Rex smiled. Rex took the wallet of a crying soccer dad.  Rex was happy.  Rex and Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora drove down the street, the sound of sirens in the distance fading...the smell of the cheesesteak wafting into Rex's young nasal passages.  A great cheesesteak is a gift from above.  A wallet filled with 20 dollar bills and an unused condom...icing on the cake.  After we divided the ill gotten booty, Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora always took 70% (until I turned 9...but that is another story)...Rex ate his cheesesteak.  Perfect bread. Juicy shredded meat. Perfectly cooked onions. The right amount of whiz. Juice ran down Rex's chin. Juice ran down Rex's hands. Rex shook in delight. That memory, and the 8 months Rex spent on the run after Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora ratted him out...will always be with him.\n\nPops Philly Cheesesteak is not only an insult to that memory it is an insult to all things with meat, cheese, bread or even hot foods.  The front page of the their website has a picture of their pitiful attempt of a cheeesteak...one of one of their abominations has green pepper on it. GREEN PEPPER!!  Let me explain something to all of you who are not from Philly...IF there was a place in Philadelphia that put green bell peppers on their cheeseteak...THE CITIZENS WOULD BURN IT DOWN!!!  It is ABSOLUTLEY 100% NOT ALLOWED IN ANY PLACE IN PHILADELPHIA!! Even if asked they WILL NOT DO IT!  So, first and foremost this is NOT A PHILLY CHEESESTEAK PLACE!!! IT IS NOT! END OF STORY!\n\nApologies. Rex passed out and needed a shot of \""Happy Serum\"" to get up right again...what is \""Happy Serum\"" you ask...heathen...it is 1 part gasoline, 1 part peach schnapps, 1 part wiper fluid. \n\nAnyway, now that we have established this is not a Philly cheesesteak, let's talk about it from a cheesesteak on it's own merits.  First, the rolls are good, the sad part is you can tell the bread is shipped frozen or frozen after it gets to Pops.  Big mistake. It really messes with the bread. It isn't bad, but again it isn't East Coast good.  Cheese...never enough. Never. If you get provolone instead of whiz it is almost non-existent. Shame on you for skimping on the cheese.  The Whiz isn't bad sometimes but more often than not there isn't enough.  The meat isn't bad. It is done well, with one BIG problem...it is often dry. Not enough oil or cooked and then recooked, whatever the reason it is not great.  If you get to Pops on the right day and get lucky, and order correctly, it isn't bad...but the overall consistency is not there.\n\nLastly...the \""Philly\"" part of the menu...the Tastycakes, the birch beer, the rest of it...all WAY TOO EXPENSIVE! At Glaziers Market you can get all the stuff for 1/5th of the price.  \n\nHere is my biggest problem...Pop's plays on East Coast memories and locals who don't know any better. That is the biggest crime. It isn't Philly. It isn't a great cheesesteak. It is over priced. It is inconsistent. It just isn't right. It just isn't good.  Most of you will never know better unless you go back east (and my next review for Pizza will tell you how to find GREAT east coast food), and they KNOW you don't know. Pop's has been a place I have tried off and on for almost 8 years.  Rex wants to love it. Rex needs to keep trying every 2 years or so...but much like when his father turned him into the cops at the tender age of 5...Rex is always hurt by Pops.

A great cheesesteak is a gift from above.  A wallet filled with 20 dollar bills and an unused condom...icing on the cake.  After we divided the ill gotten booty, Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora always took 70% (until I turned 9...but that is another story)...Rex ate his cheesesteak.  Perfect bread. Juicy shredded meat. Perfectly cooked onions. The right amount of whiz. Juice ran down Rex's chin. Juice ran down Rex's hands. Rex shook in delight. That memory, and the 8 months Rex spent on the run after Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora ratted him out...will always be with him.\n\nPops Philly Cheesesteak is not only an insult to that memory it is an insult to all things with meat, cheese, bread or even hot foods.  The front page of the their website has a picture of their pitiful attempt of a cheeesteak...one of one of their abominations has green pepper on it. GREEN PEPPER!!  Let me explain something to all of you who are not from Philly...IF there was a place in Philadelphia that put green bell peppers on their cheeseteak...THE CITIZENS WOULD BURN IT DOWN!!!  It is ABSOLUTLEY 100% NOT ALLOWED IN ANY PLACE IN PHILADELPHIA!! Even if asked they WILL NOT DO IT!  So, first and foremost this is NOT A PHILLY CHEESESTEAK PLACE!!! IT IS NOT! END OF STORY!\n\nApologies. Rex passed out and needed a shot of \""Happy Serum\"" to get up right again...what is \""Happy Serum\"" you ask...heathen...it is 1 part gasoline, 1 part peach schnapps, 1 part wiper fluid. \n\nAnyway, now that we have established this is not a Philly cheesesteak, let's talk about it from a cheesesteak on it's own merits.  First, the rolls are good, the sad part is you can tell the bread is shipped frozen or frozen after it gets to Pops.  Big mistake. It really messes with the bread. It isn't bad, but again it isn't East Coast good.  Cheese...never enough. Never. If you get provolone instead of whiz it is almost non-existent. Shame on you for skimping on the cheese.  The Whiz isn't bad sometimes but more often than not there isn't enough.  The meat isn't bad. It is done well, with one BIG problem...it is often dry. Not enough oil or cooked and then recooked, whatever the reason it is not great.  If you get to Pops on the right day and get lucky, and order correctly, it isn't bad...but the overall consistency is not there.\n\nLastly...the \""Philly\"" part of the menu...the Tastycakes, the birch beer, the rest of it...all WAY TOO EXPENSIVE! At Glaziers Market you can get all the stuff for 1/5th of the price.  \n\nHere is my biggest problem...Pop's plays on East Coast memories and locals who don't know any better. That is the biggest crime. It isn't Philly. It isn't a great cheesesteak. It is over priced. It is inconsistent. It just isn't right. It just isn't good.  Most of you will never know better unless you go back east (and my next review for Pizza will tell you how to find GREAT east coast food), and they KNOW you don't know. Pop's has been a place I have tried off and on for almost 8 years.  Rex wants to love it. Rex needs to keep trying every 2 years or so...but much like when his father turned him into the cops at the tender age of 5...Rex is always hurt by Pops. Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora and Pops...shame on you...you know better. Rex knows better. Rex deserves better. So does everyone else.

The alignment they performed was tolerable for a few months and then I noticed my inner tires were wearing unevenly. Brought it back in since the alignment had a year warranty. I drop the car off and get a call 15 minutes later blaming me for replacing more suspension parts and my warranty was voided now.

I went in with really a complete blah mood, up for really anything. We were seated in the terrase. The servers were extremely fast, professional, and friendly. Their atmosphere is pretty good too. I honestly have no idea on Afghan culture let alone on their cuisine, so this was a great intro to their stuff. Like I said their food blew me away. I had the table d'hote, which consisted of lentil soup and lamb korma, with the rose water rice pudding. Loved the soup and the korma not so much of the dessert as I dont like rose water flavor in general. The korma was splendid and my husband's sabzi poolao (spinach one) looked and tasted great too. \n\nOh plus you can BYOW here and apparently they have a cave decor on the other side of the resto thats only open during Fri's and Sat's.\n\nAnyway I cant guarantee on the authencity of the cuisine itself, but it did give me good positive feel on it.

Statement: I absolutely loved my food here. It has been a long time since a restaurant really impressed me with their food, and khyber pass really is one of the gems in that list. I went in with really a complete blah mood, up for really anything. We were seated in the terrase. The servers were extremely fast, professional, and friendly. Their atmosphere is pretty good too. I honestly have no idea on Afghan culture let alone on their cuisine, so this was a great intro to their stuff. Like I said their food blew me away. I had the table d'hote, which consisted of lentil soup and lamb korma, with the rose water rice pudding. Loved the soup and the korma not so much of the dessert as I dont like rose water flavor in general. The korma was splendid and my husband's sabzi poolao (spinach one) looked and tasted great too. \n\nOh plus you can BYOW here and apparently they have a cave decor on the other side of the resto thats only open during Fri's and Sat's.\n\nAnyway I cant guarantee on the authencity of the cuisine itself, but it did give me good positive feel on it. Overall I will definitely be more open to trying Afghan cuisine from now on. Thanks K P :)

I had been searching for something to match up since november and FINALLY, here it is. Service is great, salsa bar is yummy, and the food is delicious and authentic. I am only lacking 1 star because I wish that it was open later and especially on sundays. Also its a bit pricey from what I am used too, but as I said this kind of food was on every corner in Tucson at .75 cents a taco.

0,"Located at the corner of S. Jones and Spring Mountain near the 168 Market, this small humble eatery provides a comprehensive array of Taiwanese breakfast items that elicit childhood nostalgia for many 1st generation Taiwanese/Chinese folks and are definitely on the must-eat list for those of us second-generation folks who have been fortunate to have made a pilgrimmage back to Taiwan (or as I like to call it, Foodie Island).  \n\nSoybean milk-  this is not the chalky stuff that you find in your supermarket that adds a nice dimension to your latte or cereal, this is enjoyed straight up either as a sweetened cold/hot beverage or in a savory form where a shot of vinegar and soy triggers a reaction so that the soymilk takes on a creamy custardization accented by little bits of green onion and pickled veggies.  For those with discernible palates, I've been informed by reputable sources that the soybean milk across the street at China Mama is superior.\n\nRice Ball (Fan Twan)- a classic item my parents used to grab on the go while heading to school, don't be fooled by the simple name.  This is steamed sticky rice enclosing a savory deep fried chinese doughnut and pork sung.  The ratio of the rice and filling is perfect and it's as classic a combination as pb and j.\n\nTemple meatball (Ba Wan)-  not sure if there are any other places in town that offer this, and fortunately they make a wonderful version of this popular street food item.    Finely chopped mushrooms, bamboo, and stir-fried pork encased by a glutinous tapioca flour bun and bathed in a thick orange sweet savory sauce that has an additional note similar to cinnamon/star anise, this one will flood your head with umami and makes me think if boba and dim sum were to conceive a rockstar child, this would be it.\n\nSpicy Beef Noodle soup-   Served piping hot and can easily feed 2 or more, the meat is impeccably braised and comes with garnishes of pickled mustard greens, cilantro, scallions, and bok choy.  Detractors might say it is on the oily side and is way spicy (in which case the version at Noodle Pot may be closer to your liking), otherwise this one punches you in the face and is not shy on flavor in the best way possible.\n\nLeek Pancake- A deep-fried empanada filled with garlic chives, scrambled egg, tofu, and mung bean noodles, this is a tasty rendition if you really like garlic chives.\n\nItems that have room for improvement include the savory chinese doughnuts (yiotiao) and the sesame bun (sao bing) which I found to be a tad bit on the dry side, and the hunk of pork in the pork bun (gua bao) is also a bit oversized and lacking unctuousness (Sheridan Su does a better rendition at Great Bao which is now Fat Choy).  Looking forward to trying the pork chop with rice, sweet tofu custard (do hua), and the lotus wrapped tamales (taiwanese and shanghainese varieties available) on future visits. \n\nNot sure if this is an outpost of Yi Mei Deli Co. in Rowland Heights, CA (the fonts on the food signs look similar), but if you're expecting the same level of quality, it may come up short since they set the bar extremely high, otherwise it's a great primer on Taiwanese cuisine for the uninitiated.  Unbelievable value for your wallet but don't forget cash if you're spending under $10 and they accept visa/mastercard but no amex.","Rate the following statement ""very negative"", ""negative"", ""neutral"", ""positive"", or ""very positive"".

Finely chopped mushrooms, bamboo, and stir-fried pork encased by a glutinous tapioca flour bun and bathed in a thick orange sweet savory sauce that has an additional note similar to cinnamon/star anise, this one will flood your head with umami and makes me think if boba and dim sum were to conceive a rockstar child, this would be it.\n\nSpicy Beef Noodle soup-   Served piping hot and can easily feed 2 or more, the meat is impeccably braised and comes with garnishes of pickled mustard greens, cilantro, scallions, and bok choy.  Detractors might say it is on the oily side and is way spicy (in which case the version at Noodle Pot may be closer to your liking), otherwise this one punches you in the face and is not shy on flavor in the best way possible.\n\nLeek Pancake- A deep-fried empanada filled with garlic chives, scrambled egg, tofu, and mung bean noodles, this is a tasty rendition if you really like garlic chives.\n\nItems that have room for improvement include the savory chinese doughnuts (yiotiao) and the sesame bun (sao bing) which I found to be a tad bit on the dry side, and the hunk of pork in the pork bun (gua bao) is also a bit oversized and lacking unctuousness (Sheridan Su does a better rendition at Great Bao which is now Fat Choy).  Looking forward to trying the pork chop with rice, sweet tofu custard (do hua), and the lotus wrapped tamales (taiwanese and shanghainese varieties available) on future visits. \n\nNot sure if this is an outpost of Yi Mei Deli Co. in Rowland Heights, CA (the fonts on the food signs look similar), but if you're expecting the same level of quality, it may come up short since they set the bar extremely high, otherwise it's a great primer on Taiwanese cuisine for the uninitiated.  Unbelievable value for your wallet but don't forget cash if you're spending under $10 and they accept visa/mastercard but no amex.

Everything was wonderful.  The brisket was sliced thin.. the ribs fell off the bone.. and the turkey was juicy and flavorful.  Potatoes and cornbread were good though they were just sides and my main focus was on the meat.  \n\nThe service was great.. our server Madison was very friendly and attentive.

The meals were fantastic and the steak was prob one of the 3 best I have ever enjoyed.  Highly recommend inf you are in Scottsdale.   Not cheap, but worth it.

The receptionist says yes, there is a strong therapist.  My wife's 2nd question was if the therapist was Thai; the receptionist says no, they are Chinese...BUT they've been trained by a Thai therapist.  I have nothing against Chinese therapists (I am Chinese) when I am getting a Chinese massage.  The techniques are worlds apart.  The receptionist continues to say it's OK, many customers ask for these therapists, they are good, etc...\n\nSo we make the wrong choice and continue.\n\nWe change into their shirt and pants and lie down on the mat.  My massage starts with a foot rub and pressing on my legs.  Not much of a massage just kind of squeezing on my muscles.  Continued onto the rest of my legs.  After that she started to pull and bend my legs.  Not much pressure was being applied so I'm not sure what this \""exercise\"" was about.  Not much changed for the duration of the 1 hour.  A lot of of just lightly rubbing and petting like other Yelpers mentioned.  Rubbed my scalp, my ears, my back, my neck and my arms a few times.  Pulled on my fingers...THIS WAS NOT A MASSAGE.\nNow onto the last 1/2 hour, the foot massage.  The therapists actually switched at this point!  I didn't know what's going on until later.  Much of the same thing, squeezing my foot here and there and that's about it.\n\nMy wife is fuming about her massage while we're changing back to our clothes. \n\nFor her first hour, she had to tell the therapist where to massage and she needed to be stronger.  Nothing relaxing about this at all.  Kept telling her stronger, the therapist would press a little harder once or twice.  This one didn't have a clue of how or where to massage.  This went on for an hour.\nSo the therapists decide that they need to switch because the one massaging my wife was getting tired from using all her strength...WT??  My therapist had more energy because she was just squeezing my arms & legs, they switch so I get the tired therapist to massage my feet.  \nThe last 1/2 hour for my wife was exactly like mine, just a foot squeeze.\n\nSo we go to the front counter to tell the receptionist of what just happened.

I don't know why, but we paid and gave a tip...\n\nSo the next morning, I call and look for someone to talk to about my experience.  I called their other location and talked to a \""manager\"".  She took my number and said she'll call the \""general manager\"".\nI get a call and talk to this man and he said sorry I can't help you, you stayed for the 1.5 hours so I can't do anything for you.  I explained that what we received was not a massage and I shouldn't have to pay for this.\nHe said if the therapists used more strength, they can get in trouble if they hurt their customers.  I said they weren't even massaging their customers!  \nThis man is very impolite and did not care about customer service at all.  He hung up on me.\nOh yeah, he said we got a 20% new customer discount...we got a good price. Yeah right.\n\nPass on this place.

Finally, the tofu soup is my overall favorite Korean dish of all especially on a chilly night!  The broth mixed with my bowl of rice is the best.

I have to say I was impressed given I didn't have high expectations. The food was OK for the Price. I ordered the family meal deal with Curry Chicken, Beef Egg Rolls, Eggdrop soup, Fried Chicken strips on a skewer (I don't know what they're called), steamed rice and a side order of BBQ boneless pork ribs. The ribs were the best of them all. The egg rolls were too greasy and had a very stale texture to it. Their sweet & sour sauce was tasteless and probably just gelatin and red food dye #4. I have to admit they packed the food and soup very neatly. The delivery was within the 30min. window and a friendly guy. It's close by and I don't like Jacky Chan it's disgusting food so I would say I would order again if I was desprate and lazy to drive further to get something better. The soup was good, after I added chili to it. Overall, I wouldn't go out of my way to order from them. How can you mess up Chinese Food? I'd hate to say it, but Panda Express was way better than this, and it's not a huge nationwide chain for no reason, they got their Shhhht right whether we want to admit it or not.","Rate the following statement ""very negative"", ""negative"", ""neutral"", ""positive"", or ""very positive"".

The service was a bit slow but the guy behind the bar, Jazz, chatted with us after we pulled conversation out of him.  I mentioned we were locals.  He seemed uninterested.   \n\nWe fell in love with the decor and all the fun items in the room.   I loved the fact that we had the spot to ourselves & the decor,  so I called my husband and his business partner to join us.

After a time of them setting up equipment they asked us if we would be willing to be on camera for Bar Rescue.  We agreed.  Thank goodness we were there or they wouldn't have had anyone to show on the shoot.\n\nA guy with blue hair showed up and was hanging behind the bar.  He was rude and leaning on the bar, watching what the crew was doing.  I asked him if he should clean up or mess of empty plates, dishes and napkins, and he said no he wasn't on the clock.  He laughed and moved to be closer in the background of the camera shot.  I got his attention again and said, \""Don't you take pride in your work?  The empty glasses and trash are in the shot.

Later we found out that a guy who was watching us from the corner was the other owner.  When we left we said we would be back for the pizza.\n\nTwo weeks later my husband and I came in. Jazz was working and had no recollection of us.  How do you forget 5 locals who spent hours at your bar and eventually a camera crew making your place look good?

They had seen the Bar Rescue show and wanted to try it.  We walked in and there were 6 people at the bar.

I ordered drinks and my friend got his food order out.  Jazz then turned his back to us and started making his way around the bar again.  Checking on people and chatting with them.

Did you hear about that.\""  I nodded dumbfounded.\n\n\""Ever since that has happened I quit.  I have substituted it with sausage.  You will like it.\""  He said.  I wanted to call BS because the Firefly incident had happened in May or late April.  I had been to this spot twice in less than a month and they had it, but at this point why argue.

We were here for Thanksgiving holiday and the service line for checking in was massive and it took at least 40 minutes before we were able to check in.  Customer service needs to move at rapid speed.  Our rep took some time to check us in at first telling us we were on the 3rd floor, then changed it again saying we were now on the 5th.  Annoying!  We also told her that we had two separate reservations and she indicated that she had taken care of everything for us.  However, she failed to tell us that our cards would be deactivated so late night we get back to our room only to find out we have to walk that long mile again back to the lobby to get our room keys activated again.  Annoyed!  \n\nThe rooms are some kinda funky.  Small sink and water deeps out of the shower, if you are not careful.

I've heard for months from friends and fellow yelpers about how awesome this place is, so we decided to give it a try for early Vday dinner. \n\nThe atmosphere is very very nice. Nice little cottage with a kitchen (where they have a few tables next to the chef), a dining area, and an outside patio area. There are lots of candles and can be romantic place. The waiters were all nice, but we had some issues with the service. A group of 4 that came 20mins later than us(just 2) sat next to our table and kept getting food quicker than us. The most annoying part was that the waiters kept telling us our food would come, but the speed and service was definitely lacking. \n\nAs for the food, it was definitely worth 3+ stars except for the main chicken pesto dish. It was just two butterflied chicken pieces with pesto sauce, no vegetables, no special sauce, nothing special. I did love the appetizer 1 (white bean soup with side of bread with asiago cheese), appetizer 2 (barley and poached shrimp w/ sweet asian chili sauce), and one of the main dishes (pork tenderloin with a sweet chutney/hint of curry sauce and asparagus). The dessert was just some strawberries and fudge brownie. Again, nothing special.\n\nAll in all, I did like the experience, but the food left me thinking there could have been more or that it could have been better. Maybe I went in thinking too highly of this place. I am willing to give it another try, but it's not #1 that I would recommend to a friend.\n\n** I wanted to add something. Chris, the owner of the restaurant sent me an apology via email and phone call. This says a lot considering chefs will get very offended if you talk remotely bad about their food/creations. I have to admit. I feel bad if I seem very cruel in my review, but I feel that I was not over-exaggerating anything. I like to think that I speak the truth and hopefully readers can appreciate that.

There was a 45 minute wait for a table, but we quickly snagged a table in the bar area, which wasn't too loud or busy. I had a really delicious malbec and we both had soup as appetizers - lobster bisque and cream of mushroom. They were both delicious, and after eating the soup and the warm bread and flaxseed crisps they give out free, I knew we were probably in for a good meal. When our entrees came, we weren't disappointed.

Statement: I came here for a filling after not having time to get it completed by my hometown dentist over Christmas break in early 2011. Not only was the filling $120 (no insurance), payment was demanded immediately upon exit, I also felt very disrespected by the office as a whole. The front staff is very curt and short. The gentleman who did my drilling had a patronizing and smart alleck attitude. When asking questions about the procedure he was doing, he mockingly imitated my voice (I am sorry I am not the most clear and articulate when I have a rod down my mouth getting a filling) to ask me what I said. He was very patronizing the whole time and unsympathetic to my legitimate worries I had seeing as this was the first time I went to a dentist other than the one I went to my entire life since childhood. I would never go back under any circumstance.\n\nEDIT: In my original review I stated this procedure was $250. The correct amount was actually $120. My apologies.

The pizza was basically Freschetta ultra-thin crust, made to order.

These get 2 paragraphs, but for the wrong reasons:\n\nFish n' chips batter should be bound to the fish at the molecular level. Attempting to peel the crust off should result in tearing away fish flesh, or revealing fish that is crispy around the edge with the bound batter unwilling to separate. Fish n' Chips don't bend! Cook hot, cook fast, cook through. You can easily achieve this at home with a Waring fryer. A decent batter and a properly used commercial fryer should be a slam-dunk. \n\nAnatomy of an unacceptable fish n' chip: hunk of barely cooked through whitefish, surrounded by a loose layer of mushy batter than is not bound to the fish at all, with a fried-looking but barely crisp outer edge. I removed the end of the fish stick and shook it and the lump of fish fell out of the sad greasy tube. No discernible flavor unless dunked in the accompanying restaurant supply grade tartar slop. \n\nTots? A moment of inspiration? Sadly no. The key to a tot is that it's made up of little distinct chunks of potato. Like a tiny hash brown capsule. You should be able to break them open and pull apart the pieces.

In the meantime, if the owners (investors, more like) care to be more than just the next thing to FAILBOAT in that space, they need to get back to the food. Once the buzz fades, the food will not bring people back. Go to Four Peaks Tempe. Go to Matt's Big B. Go to George n' Dragon. Go to Lo Lo's for chrissake.

I'm not drunk enough for this.\n\nI want to give it 3 stars for being clean, having decent service and having no less than 20 plasma displays. But 3 is A-okay. I think there might be something A-okay there, but we haven't found it yet. We will return to try the sliders just to see if there is a dependable fallback dish for those nights when we just don't feel like cooking and want somewhere close. In the meantime, if the owners (investors, more like) care to be more than just the next thing to FAILBOAT in that space, they need to get back to the food. Once the buzz fades, the food will not bring people back. Go to Four Peaks Tempe. Go to Matt's Big B. Go to George n' Dragon. Go to Lo Lo's for chrissake. Go see how simple food can still be good food, and not scream \""short-term, dabbling in the industry business model\"".\n\nWill update after another visit. Maybe.

Everyone I was with at the table said that they thought the meal was lacking in a way.\n\nThis visit took place in mid-May 2010, and I'm not sure if they had just gotten a new cook, or had some other issue. That is the only time I've been there, so I can't testify to much...but when I go back to visit Phoenix, I won't be going to El Encanto.

He jumped from one client to another. He started with my hair and did 4 other clients in between while I waited!! Finally he finished and I just wanted to get out if there. When I got home and took a closer look at my highlights, they were yellow. I asked if he used a toner and he said no. He didn't offer to tone my hair or fix the color. I had to go to another salon to have them tone it. In a matter of days my extensions (that Eli did) started to fall out. He told me to come back and he would fix them, which he did but in a matter weeks all my extensions fell out! So AGAIN I had to go to another salon to redo/fix my highlights and extensions.

That continued for 35 minutes while other tables with larger groups who were seated after us were served before us... 35 minutes for three bowls of soup, a garden salad (which never came) and a couple pieces of fried fish?  I think not.  We flagged down a manager who said he was finishing it right up.  And then when the food came out, it was cold.

If you like that, eat here.  If you like having service at a restaurant, and warm seafood, go to Red Lobster instead.\nOn the way out, I saw a TON of food under heat lamps on their line, and some of it coming out of steamtables... absolutely NO excuse for cold, cream-based soup... and no excuse for that small of an order taking 35 minutes.\nI usually give places two shots, just in case they were having an off day.

This is the first time I have actually been inside. I heard that it has recently been redone, so I cannot compare it to prior, but I thought the place looked rather inviting. Unfortunately, the food is just not that good. We had the calamari fritti, which I consider a safe choice. They did not taste bad - they tasted like nothing at all. I tried putting lemon on them, then marinara sauce, then salt. Finally I dipped them in olive oil. Each time it made them more memorable, but not more edible. We also tried the pizza (both the Italian meat pizza and the pesto chicken one). If I had bought a frozen pizza at the store and it tasted like that fresh out of the oven I would have thought of it as pretty good pizza and probably bought it again. However, I expect more of an Italian restaurant, especially considering how long it took to prepare (and there was only one other couple in the entire place). \nOverall, I am just disappointed.

Well, my girlfriends and I happen to be in Vegas on a Wednesday so we decided to hit up Eclipse. Since discovering Surrender's nighttime pool club, we've been a fan of that scene since. We got a $500 comped table from a host, Kwame, who was awesome btw! He got us checked in and everything ran smoothly. \n\nWelp, that's where it ended. Our waitress, Kelly, was awful. Awful awful lady! She didn't seem to want us there. She over poured our drinks, which I assume to get us to buy a new bottle quicker. My group of girls are all pretty petite, I think you can assume that our tolerance isn't that high. She made us 6 drinks, and the entire bottle was almost finished. You can only assume that those were some stiff drinks! Then when we found out we got charged for 8 water bottles, totaling to over $50 we were super annoyed with the fact that she was annoyed with us. She tells me, \""You said you wanted water.\"" I kindly replied, \""Yes, I did want water, as a mixer for my vodka waters, but I did request 8 bottles.\"" Especially at such a high price! I'm not that frugal but her attitude stunk! She made me feel cheap. Look lady, your 22% gratuity may already be included, but you can at least try to act like you're working for your money! After that, she took our whole bottle service away, just as quickly as we finished our last drop of vodka. RUDE! I've never felt so rushed and embarrassed. And the shitty thing is that her tip for her hour and a half of waiting on us, which was very minimal might I add, was over $130. \n\nEclipse, itself is okay. Big ordinary pool in the center so you can walk around the entire perimeter. DJ set up is at one end of the pool and the bar was opposite of that. It wasn't too visually appealing though.

0,"My husband and I usually come in on Tuesdays for the .35 wing special. The service is always bad but we usually overlook it as there are few places to eat in San Tan Valley and we kind of like the wings.  Tonight's experience especially unsatisfactory.   Disappointment all around.  Still not sure on who was supposed to be our actual waitress.  We waited a very unreasonable amount of time to get our drinks and have our order taken.  We finally got our beer from a gal but she said she can't take our order for food and we asked her to send over someone who can.  In fact, after waiting over 20 minutes after putting in our drink order, and still not having someone take our order, we had to pull a waitress from the other dining room to take our order and she was kind enough to do so.  She was already busy and seemed to be the only one actually being productive.   A short blonde waitress finally brought our wings finally after more than a half hour but didn't even give us time to ask for napkins and plates before running off only to spend about 10 minutes with who appeared to be her boyfriend and some friends a couple booths over.  We watched this short blonde waitress carry on with her boyfriend and she seemed to have a very foul attitude.  We assumed she was the \""intended\"" waitress for our table but evidentley not because a 4th waitress came to our table to check on us and she said she was our waitress apologetically because we were just finally meeting at the end of our meal.  We waited another unreasonabe amount of time for the check and a couple boxes for the leftover wings.  She finally came back with the check and a tiny box and said that was all she was allowed to give us for the dozen or so left over wings.  This box only held a few wings and we had 2 different flavors.  I told her how getting and adequate to go box has never been a problem in the past and insisted on speaking to the manager.  The manager \""Brooke\"" came to the table and I asked for an adequate box for our leftover wings and she said it's the rules not to give any more than the 1 tiny styrofoam box.  I could tell she wasn't the usual manager because she was dead set on passing the buck to the normal manager saying how they are even stricter with the rules than she is.  After I told her we are Tuesday regulars and she is clearly new to Tuesdays and lecturing her on how a good manager would handle things correctly without passing the buck and making the regular customer feel unimportant , she agreed to give us another tiny box.  But ONLY this time.  She really had no concern for the complaint about the bad service and in fact dismissed our concerns.  Tonight's experience was 100% a result of terrible management and may cost this restraunt a couple of good once a week regular patrons.  So if you happen to visit this place on a Tuesday and you have the misfortune of having the fill in Manager named Brooke, expect a similar experience and make sure you eat every wing your served at the table because they are too cheap to give an adequate to go box for the leftovers and they would rather the food just go to waste.","Rate the following statement ""very negative"", ""negative"", ""neutral"", ""positive"", or ""very positive"".

We waited another unreasonabe amount of time for the check and a couple boxes for the leftover wings.  She finally came back with the check and a tiny box and said that was all she was allowed to give us for the dozen or so left over wings.  This box only held a few wings and we had 2 different flavors.  I told her how getting and adequate to go box has never been a problem in the past and insisted on speaking to the manager.  The manager \""Brooke\"" came to the table and I asked for an adequate box for our leftover wings and she said it's the rules not to give any more than the 1 tiny styrofoam box.  I could tell she wasn't the usual manager because she was dead set on passing the buck to the normal manager saying how they are even stricter with the rules than she is.  After I told her we are Tuesday regulars and she is clearly new to Tuesdays and lecturing her on how a good manager would handle things correctly without passing the buck and making the regular customer feel unimportant , she agreed to give us another tiny box.  But ONLY this time.  She really had no concern for the complaint about the bad service and in fact dismissed our concerns.  Tonight's experience was 100% a result of terrible management and may cost this restraunt a couple of good once a week regular patrons.  So if you happen to visit this place on a Tuesday and you have the misfortune of having the fill in Manager named Brooke, expect a similar experience and make sure you eat every wing your served at the table because they are too cheap to give an adequate to go box for the leftovers and they would rather the food just go to waste.

My chief complaint here is the sushi rice, which is closest to the dreaded Costco or supermarket style of sushi rice: bland and mushy.

You should not be able to smear it on the roof of your mouth with your tongue. \n\nYou could do a lot worse though. Service was fine, but strained due to severe language or accent barrier.

I had a Moscow Mule while my husband had a craft beer.  Both were served cold and within 5 minutes of being seated.  My husband had a burger while I had a light shrimp cocktail.  My husband really enjoyed his burger, but the fries were the star of the meal.  They were definitely plentiful, and enough to share between the two of us.  So delicious!  The shrimp cocktail was okay, it didn't taste as fresh as others I have had in Vegas, and for the $24 price tag, it definitely was on the very steep end considering the portion size and overall quality.  \n\nWe would consider going here again, but I will definitely try another chilled seafood item from the raw menu - which was pretty impressive for a pub specializing in hearty fare.  Cheers!

0,Well if anyone deserves ZERO STARS HERE WE ARE!  I have been here twice and had ok meals. This time today was my worst dining experience ever. I ordered an omelette and out comes the server with our food and he was the one who noticed a hair on it. Sent back only to return with another pretty looking omelette with a Hair on top!!! I was so appalled. Can you imagine this happening twice ? My friends were about done with their food when I gave then a 3rd chance. This time we were good but my toast was full of butter which isn't what I ordered. Anyway. They were nice to take it off the bill and my fresh food was good even though everyone else on my table was done eating and just watching me. What awful\nLuck...

No matter what you choose, you know exactly how many calories are in each (the calorie count is next to each menu item). \n\nI devoured the chipotle chicken wrap (380 calories). The veggies were plentiful and fresh, and the flatbread was the perfect thickness--soft but not flimsy. The chipotle sauce was flavorful, with just the right amount of heat.  My only complaint is the smaller portion of chicken--more is always better.  Try the peppadew hot sauce on your meal!  Wayyyyy better than Tabasco. \n\nIt would be PERFECT if there was one located closer to Scottsdale...So many tasty options, all at very reasonable prices--$5 got me the wrap, a drink and my choice of chips, a cookie or a brownie.

There were only a handful of people seated, but the waitress would not seat us. Finally after 10 minutes she came up to us and said in a snotty tone \""can you read\"" I was a little puzzled... And said excuse me.... She said I guess you still don't see it......ok, I thought... Then she pointed to an obscure little sign that said seat yourself and just walked off. We sat at the table for over 10 minutes and she never even glanced in our direction! I will never go back!

0,"I tried this place as it replaced the old Red Brick Pizza that was there. The inside is pretty much the same as it was as Red Brick. The owner was nice and greeted us and said goodbye at the end. The televisions had a Ratatouille Disney DVD playing and when that finished they put on the old Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Didn't care for the shows but I wasn't there to watch television anyway. They were out of drink cup covers so I asked for some and the kid brings them out and takes his bare hands and grabs out two of them. I would have rather he have gloves and place them in the holder so I can grab my own without his touching them or at least would dig down into the center to avoid the ones he did touch.\n\nHowever, the pizza wasn't good. As much as I like cheese on my Four Cheese pizza, there was too much cheese, soggy crust, and burnt edges. Could barely get a slice apart and when I did manage to cut it apart and picked up a slice, the cheese just slide right off into the pan. I ended up with a pile of cheese and the pizza wasn't tasty at all. My friend got a barbecue chicken pizza and it didn't taste like it as she used to get that at Red Brick just like I always got my Four Cheese. The Red Brick pizza was awesome and the cheese at least stayed on the slices. As much as I wanted to like this place since I hoped it was like the old Red Brick, this pizza wasn't any good.

Let me start with the burrito...aside of onions and the dried chicken and beef inside, there was nothing to this... I think I make 100% better mexican food than this people, and I'm from Panama--LOL... now the soup, yak... horrible and the salad, had a big peace of lettuce that looked like fungus was growing on it... my little one gagged... I almost complained, but what's the point, we are never going there again... better off going to and Humberto, Roberto, Filiberto...whatever you called those places... believe me you will never be this disappointed.","Rate the following statement ""very negative"", ""negative"", ""neutral"", ""positive"", or ""very positive"".

0,"I'm not vegetarian or vegan myself, but I can definitely appreciate what a restaurant like Green can dish up to entice even the staunchest meat lover. In reality, everything on the menu looked amazing - fresh ingredients, inventive dishes, and always healthy. I decided to order the \""Moo-shroom BBQ Po-Boy\"" sandwich, which consisted of sliced portobello slathered in sweet and tasty barbeque sauce. It came with a side of house cole slaw made with a hint of peanut butter to enhance the flavor. Both were VERY good.\n\nGreen doesn't look like much from the outside, but inside is an entirely different story. All of the walls are covered with really cool recycled art i.e. old, painted VW hubcaps, menus cut up and made to look like birds flying through plastic grocery bag clouds, etc. You really just have to see it. The bottom line is, you get a strong vibe of responsibility for what you put into your body as well as the greater environment. \n\nI'm looking forward to visiting Green again the next time I'm in the Tempe area.","Rate the following statement ""very negative"", ""negative"", ""neutral"", ""positive"", or ""very positive"".
