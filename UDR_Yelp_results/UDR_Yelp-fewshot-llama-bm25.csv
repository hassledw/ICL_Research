My roommate and I decided to get pedicures on our vacation.  We tried to look up some locations and prices. We couldn't find many places that listed prices but ran across great reviews for the Qua Spa at Cesaer's on yelp and decided to make an appointment. It turns out that Qua is the spa and Color is the salon. We were a little disappointed because we wanted to see what Qua was like.\n\nWe were lead in and given mimosas. The place is very bright white and has a lot of marble. Allyn did my pedicure and was really nice and easy to talk to. The chairs have a great rolling massage option which was better than the typical vibrating chair massage. They also played fun top 40's which my roommate and I bopped along too as we joked around with our pedicurists.

0,"If you read my reviews in the past, I'm always writing a very positive and honest review.  Please don't be fooled when you walk in their store.  You will never have anyone come up to you to greet and to help you!  It's because, yes, they have what appears to be cool fish, but if you inquire, they'll sell you an illegal fish, too!  If I was able to give a zero star rating, I feel that would be a too generous of a rating for Trop-aquarium.  So let me expand on the facts I've experienced with this company.  First off Trop-Aquarium is the company that installed my 500 gallon fresh water tank which is built in a double sided wall.  The reason why we chose them was because they were less expensive than all the other quotes we received.  But in this case you really get what you pay for and less.  The reason for obtaining such a large fresh water tank was because I love large fish like big parrot fish and mainly an Arrowana.  We had 35 very large fish in the tank that we paid handsomely to Trop- Aquarium.  One Friday at noon 6 of our large fish died so because Trop- Aquarium maintained our tank, I texted, called and left a message immediately!  No response for a whole 3 days.  By now I'm frantically calling them because all 30 of my expensive fish had died.  Finally they pick up the phone and asked if I had over fed the fish, giggling and that they'll come in a day or two.  However meanwhile I, an unexperienced aquarium maintainer, was told that I need to remove all 30 dead corpses and to buy an airline with air rocks, 2 large buckets, tube everything properly, catch the remainder live fish, place them in the properly tubed buckets all at 12:36 am midnight.  They also offered if I don't know how to just leave the tank with only the dead fish removed, but I was sure all the live fish would've died by the time they came.  When they finally came days after, they realized that they had not glued down the returns.  So all the fish brutally suffocated before dieing.  The Trop-Aquarium technician cleaned the tank, drilled random visible holes in the Clear Vision tank to stick the airline pipe attached to the air rock that I had both purchased.  They verbally admitted to the installation error!  They then replaced our dead fish with 5 fish which were the size of a silver dollar.  Soon after their billing called us and said we owed them over $1000 for the work they did to fix the installation problem they created!  I contacted other aquarium builders and when they saw the tank, all six companies stated and agreed that no one ever would build a tank with no overflow mini tank and returns at the bottom.  Trop-Aquarium did this so that they would be the exclusive company to convert the tank, maintain it and also this way, they'd make a larger profit!  So, in conclusion, if you have limitless amount of money to burn,  want the cheapest specimen of fish in your fish tank, never want to get a timely response, and over all get scammed in the long run, Trop-Aquarium would be perfect for you!!!  Time is the true revealer of how a people are and how companies truly operate.  During my rough 5 year relationship with Trop- Aquarium, I come to realization that making $$$MONEY$$$ is their only priority and having a honest customer oriented business is NOT!!!!!  I WOULD NEVER WISH THIS EXPERIENCE UPON ANYONE ELSE!  You may have to pay a little more initially with another company, but in the long run over all, you will exceed a great amount of money you ever envisioned with Trop-Aquarium.","This is definitely a quality Asian market, one that holds up to the kinds of markets I adored back in Cali. \n\nFirstly, it's clean and spacious.

However meanwhile I, an unexperienced aquarium maintainer, was told that I need to remove all 30 dead corpses and to buy an airline with air rocks, 2 large buckets, tube everything properly, catch the remainder live fish, place them in the properly tubed buckets all at 12:36 am midnight.  They also offered if I don't know how to just leave the tank with only the dead fish removed, but I was sure all the live fish would've died by the time they came.  When they finally came days after, they realized that they had not glued down the returns.  So all the fish brutally suffocated before dieing.  The Trop-Aquarium technician cleaned the tank, drilled random visible holes in the Clear Vision tank to stick the airline pipe attached to the air rock that I had both purchased.  They verbally admitted to the installation error!  They then replaced our dead fish with 5 fish which were the size of a silver dollar.  Soon after their billing called us and said we owed them over $1000 for the work they did to fix the installation problem they created!  I contacted other aquarium builders and when they saw the tank, all six companies stated and agreed that no one ever would build a tank with no overflow mini tank and returns at the bottom.  Trop-Aquarium did this so that they would be the exclusive company to convert the tank, maintain it and also this way, they'd make a larger profit!  So, in conclusion, if you have limitless amount of money to burn,  want the cheapest specimen of fish in your fish tank, never want to get a timely response, and over all get scammed in the long run, Trop-Aquarium would be perfect for you!!!  Time is the true revealer of how a people are and how companies truly operate.  During my rough 5 year relationship with Trop- Aquarium, I come to realization that making $$$MONEY$$$ is their only priority and having a honest customer oriented business is NOT!!!!!  I WOULD NEVER WISH THIS EXPERIENCE UPON ANYONE ELSE!  You may have to pay a little more initially with another company, but in the long run over all, you will exceed a great amount of money you ever envisioned with Trop-Aquarium.

I've been here a few times since I moved in across the street about a year ago. Usually I'm in for a pedicure and I'm out. Their pedicures are decent, nothing special but appropriately priced. I've tried other places in the area because my brow lady that practices right next door to this place says the manicurists are treated like crud. Next time I'll take that more to heart, but I was in the area and needed a pedi so I stopped in again.\n\nI recently got into the gel manicure trend. I have had a few done at other places and decided to get one while I went in for my usual pedi. My manicurist, Debbie, didn't speak to me at all, even when I tried to compliment her technique. She also gave me a massage while my hands were in her hair which I was turned off by.\n\nThe polish on my thumb chipped the next day. I know this isn't the norm for gel manicures so I went back after work.

I will start by saying that my daughter and I made a special trip to get these bagels fresh in the morning, and I was so disappointed!\n\nFirst of all, weighing in on the bagel debate, I do prefer NY bagels (for which I have also been known to make special pilgrimages).  Montreal's are thinner and somewhat sweet, which is less enjoyable to me.\n\nThat said, some of the dozen bagels sold to me were actually stale and had to be day old.  The best and freshest was probably the sesame.  However, we decided after trying both St. Viateur and Fairmount, that Montreal bagels are not for us.  I think many Americans who have experienced high-quality bagels in NYC might agree.  Frankly, I can even do better at several places in Boston.\n\nMontreal has amazing French food; I guess I don't need it to compete with NY for the Jewish angle.  (I also think Schwartz's is way overrated.)

So my review is inflated because I didn't go at night.  I took my little brother here during the day on a Sunday.  The place was dead, so we were able to get a lane easily of course.  I thought $35 an hour was pretty steep, but with 4 people it turned out to be a deal.  \n\nWe didn't order any food so I can't really say much about that, but the service was excellent.  We wanted beer but got there at 11:45, so the waitress took our order and by 12:01 we had our beers on the table.  She was also really friendly and gave me a round for free because it was my birthday.  \n\nI would love to come back sometime and experience it at night when I am sure it is way cooler, but then again I probably don't want to have to fight the huge crowds that come.  If I'm ever in the area looking for something to do, I will probably suggest coming here.

My first review :) A friend took my sister and I here for our birthday. Staff was really nice and our server was great. We asked her for some recommendations. I ordered the Hawaiian ribeye and omg!!!! It was definitely the best steak I have had so far! It was mouthwatering and the flavor is laced throughout the whole meat. It was a good sized piece, 12 oz probably, and it was so good that I finished it all. I can't wait to go back and have more soon! The spinach dip is yummy too! Wasn't a fan of the five but brownie though, that is why I am giving this place a 4.5 instead of a 5. Not sure how to give half stars. Either way... I'm coming back for sure :)

We r from chicago and came to khyber halal after reading positive reviews on yelp. The restaurant is charming, quaint, and well - decorated with authentic afghani decor and pieces, also very clean. The owner/head chef Fahima greeted us and was our server. She was incredibly pleasant and gave us great recommendations. She discussed that she tries to use organic ingredients and tries to make dishes healthy for her customers. All of her meat entrees are halal.\n\nOur first visit we had beef samosa and shami kabob for appetizers. Each came with fresh green chutney and tasted as if she had just freshly hand made the dough, meat, and chutney. We ate afghani dishes including kabli pulao and uzbek pulao, both spectacular. The helpings of rice are heaping, and you'll definitely have leftovers. Thr prices are very reasonable.\n\nSince our visit, my family reminisced about the delicious taste of her food every meal in phoenix, nothing compared. We came back and tried her pakistani dishes, equally delicious! Her naan is so plump and tastes made in a tandoor.  This place is always crowded and filled with a diverse crowd.  Mango lassi is perfect after a morning hike. Dessert including phirni and baklawa taste homemade.\n\nWe will probably b back again during our vacation, but wanted to post this since I am truly in love with this place. The owner Fahima is incredibly talented and will probably b known as a great chef in the near future.  \n\nIf you are in phoenix, definitely visit this place, your taste buds will not forget it!

We paid $59/night for a Fri-Sat stay, which is far less than you could get for a similar room on the Strip. \n\nThe room was very nicely decorated in Earth tones. Our room had a very comfortable king sized bed, two night stands, a love seat in a small sitting area, dining table, and a television armoire. They haven't yet upgraded to flat screen televisions in the Deluxe King rooms, but we didn't spend any time in the room watching television anyway. There is a safe located inside the television armoire, which is very small, but suitable for cameras and small electronic equipment. \nAir conditioning worked very well, although the unit itself was somewhat noisy. This actually turned out to be a plus, as the night we arrived they were having a Zumba dance party by the pool, and listening to the air conditioner was more pleasant than the horrid music pumping out during the marathon exercise session\n. \nThe bathroom is small, but perfectly adequate. The biggest complaint was that the shower head was too low for my 6'3\"" sweetie. Otherwise, the bathroom was stocked with plenty of towels along with Bath and Body Works products. Hot water was plentiful and the water pressure was great.\n\nThe casino itself is awesome. Very large, plenty of slot machines and table games are available. The Silverton Rewards club provides great benefits, and we both received a pass to Seasons Buffet once we earned 50 points on the Rewards Card (which took all of about 20 minutes to earn). We are both non-smokers, and neither of us had any complaints about excessive smoke in the casino. In fact, the only time I ever noticed smoke was if a smoker sat down next to me. Wait staff in the casino was FAR superior to any of the casinos we played at on the Strip.\n\nThe restaurants at Silverton are fabulous. We ate at nearly every single restaurant on property and enjoyed them all. I wouldn't say that Seasons was the greatest buffet in the world, but it was clean, food was well stocked, and our waiter was right on top of everything. Mi Casa Cantina serves up excellent Mexican food at a very reasonable price. The Sundance Grill is open 24 hours and provides casual dining with late night food specials. We ate breakfast here; it was tasty and very budget friendly. Johnny Rockets is also located on the casino floor, but we did not eat here on this trip. The flagship of the Silverton dining experience is Twin Creeks- which is an absolute must-visit during your trip. It has a beautifully romantic ambiance, and serves upscale steakhouse fare at prices much lower than similar restaurants on the Strip. The Tomahawk Rib Eye was simply divine! I just can't say enough about this incredible restaurant and the amazing staff.\nThe Silverton is connected to a Bass Pro Shop. If you are into that kind of thing, this store is huge and gorgeous. We went in and walked around, but didn't buy anything. Neither one of us are into outdoor sports, so I can't comment on whether or not the place is overpriced.\n\nThe best thing about the Silverton is the overall atmosphere and service level. The staff members were all very accommodating, helpful, and extremely friendly. We didn't have a bad experience with a single staff member on property, and we went everywhere. Upon our arrival at around 11am, we had practically no wait for service, and the front desk clerk had no problem giving us an early check in time. All the housekeeping staff made sure to say hello anytime they walked by, and all of the wait staff members in the restaurants were attentive and friendly. The casino caters to a slightly older clientele with some locals, and since there isn't a nightclub on property, there is very little pretentiousness among the guests. Everyone we ran into was relaxed and polite. And then there is the convenience factor; everything at the hotel/casino is within a 5 minute walk from your room, and the hotel is all of 10 minutes away from the Strip. Free shuttle service runs from the hotel to the airport, and to Caesar's Palace on the Strip if you don't have a car. \n\nIf it sounds like I'm gushing upon the Silverton, it's because I am.

Normally, service here is excellent. But tonight? FAIL. We're regulars at the Scottsdale location; it's walking distance from home!  Well tonight we waited quite a longer time than usual for our dinner. Even the manager came over to apologize as well as our waitress. No offer of a discount on our bill, free desert, nothing! We're not the type to be verbal, but when both the mgr and waitress are aware of an issue, and does nothing for the customer....thats an even bigger disappointment. :(

Yes, you've heard correctly; If you want to use your OWN irons you have to play from the lower deck, otherwise you MUST use the lame (and short) clubs provided by the place. It is a real shame that an amazing place like this has been ruined by such POOR MANAGEMENT DECISIONS. I will not go back to that place until they allow the use of ALL clubs (driver included). Make's no sense what they are doing. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED. POTENTIALLY A GREAT PLACE JUST RUINED BY MANAGEMENT.

This place is close to my work so I'm here at least twice a week for cheap produce and reasonably priced meats.  The selection is still great, and I've noticed over the months that more and more non-Latinos shop here!  Good job people!  Cheapy like me!  Their produce prices sure beat the local Albertson's and Vons and Smith's by a long shot.  The only other place I get veggies is the Asian market but that's only because those yummy types of veggies aren't found here at Cardenas.

Well, that could also be because the stocker doesn't understand English very well.  In either case, you're out of luck.\n\nCardenas is still mostly one stop shop for your Mexican needs.  Besides the large supermarket area, you still have your juice bar, bakery, deli, and tortilleria stations within the store.  The tortillas here are pretty good, I'm spoiled now...I only buy fresh made corn tortillas from the tortilleria for my tacos!  They taste 100 times better when they are made only a few hours ago.  Really makes a difference in your Mexican dishes.\n\nThe juice bar is tasty, with fresh concoctions of strawberry and watermelon juices, or a fresh fruit smoothie.  It's better if you know a bit of Spanish because the drink orders can get confusing.  Got what I thought was supposed to be a strawberry smoothie, but they for some reason added beets!

The worst part came when the entire group had been served, except for one of us.  When we inquired about this she said - and this is verbatim - 'If we waited to bring it out until it was all ready, the fish would go bad'.  We also received our appetizer AFTER we had finished our meal, with no apology or explanation. \n\nIf the food was amazing I would say putting up with all this was tolerable, but it just isn't.  The servings are skimpy and there is more rice than anything else in most rolls.  Their specialty rolls are not even served with wasabi or ginger.  The failed mexi-japanese fusion menu is more flash than fish.  \n\nI sincerely hope the owners and management have more experience expediting a kitchen than our experience indicated, or that the waitress seemed to be aware of.  I've never heard such a ridiculous excuse for guests not being served at the same time.  Never, ever again.

It is possible that for the purposes of routine shots and other 40$ treatments/procedures/matters, this animal hospital is perfectly fine.

We meant to take her to a higher rated Animal Hospital that is in the same area, but there was an error committed in mapping out the directions so we came to CHAM instead. What followed was the doctor taking a series of xrays (one of which was taken incorrectly, which I had to pay to have retaken at another hospital) and going to the HIGH side of a quote instantaneously. Her recommendation was so extreme (barium GI tract exploration) that the other hospital would not even believe that it was recommended by a veterinarian.  \n\nWhen we asked if it were possible that the xrays results be given to us in hard form so we could get another opinion when the veterinarian was going to show us her findings (this is post-the barium recommendation), she abruptly shut down the presentation/sales pitch for barium and stormed out of the room.

Another review liken this 'animal hospital' to a dealership. In a way I agree, except that comparison may be giving Centennial Hills Animal Hospital (CHAM) too much credit and is too unfair to dealerships. \n\nThe experience is so unpleasant I don't actually want to author this review. It is possible that for the purposes of routine shots and other 40$ treatments/procedures/matters, this animal hospital is perfectly fine. You may want to consider if it is fine or not, but I don't believe for larger, serious procedures (surgery) you should consider CHAM at all. If you are reading this because there may be something seriously wrong with your smaller animal friend, and your first choice is not to kill them, start looking for a different option now. Don't even finish reading this overly long review; just look for another Animal Hospital, please. You're welcome.\n\nThe cat that lives with us was sick. She was vomiting constantly, quite violently. We meant to take her to a higher rated Animal Hospital that is in the same area, but there was an error committed in mapping out the directions so we came to CHAM instead. What followed was the doctor taking a series of xrays (one of which was taken incorrectly, which I had to pay to have retaken at another hospital) and going to the HIGH side of a quote instantaneously. Her recommendation was so extreme (barium GI tract exploration) that the other hospital would not even believe that it was recommended by a veterinarian.  \n\nWhen we asked if it were possible that the xrays results be given to us in hard form so we could get another opinion when the veterinarian was going to show us her findings (this is post-the barium recommendation), she abruptly shut down the presentation/sales pitch for barium and stormed out of the room. It was like a bad SNL skit (think Will Ferrell as a doctor). \n\nThey charged an extra 5$ for the CD that the xray results were placed in. \n\nIn the end, the poor cat was just constipated. You can't make this shit up. - E

I've been dreaming of it since I got back from a visit to Green Bay last summer ;)\n\nI was excited to hear that Culver's opened here in Mesa -- I don't eat their burgers, but it' s nice to have a place for frozen custard -- there are so few places for any type of frozen dessert

My first time ever hearing of Rita's, but I am glad we stopped.\nThe custard is kind of like soft serve ice cream but creamier (or more eggy, but in a good way).\nThe staff was very friendly, and the Italian ice is really tasty with loads of revolving fun flavors.\n\nI came here twice in my week visit to Vegas and would for sure come again!

Gourmet hot dogs are where it's at. Station Street Hot Dogs takes the crown when it comes to Pittsburgh gourmet hot dogs, and so if you enjoy putting tasty things on other tasty things, this is the place for you. If you don't like hot dogs, or are a vegetarian, they also have tacos. So, really, you don't have a reason to not eat here. Station Street Hot Dogs is open until November 22 with limited hours--11 AM to 2:30 PM. Do yourself a favor and go get a bite.\n\nI have a weird habit of saving my favorite Pittsburgh restaurants for review only after I find out that they're closing (see: Embury, Fukuda; or the reviews I never wrote for T-Rav's BBQ Lab). Rick Sebak likes to talk about Things That Aren't There Anymore, and so in true Rick Sebak fashion, hopefully one day we'll be able to reminisce about the wonderful food when we sit in Pittsburgh circles and talk about Stuff That's Gone; in the big list of our favorites, Station Street Hot Dogs is sure to be there.\n\nFantastic hot dogs, crispy fries, delicious tacos (corn or flour tortilla, hon), and awesome rotating menu of rice-balls, mustard-grilled hamburgers, and reubens (just to name a few).\n\nThe other day I walked in with a friend or two and ordered my final meal--one of each of their gourmet hot dogs, a nice big order of poutine fries, and a Mexican Coca Cola. I call it a Dog Show. Luckily, they're closing, because I never want to look at a hot dog again.

Jones and Spring Mountain near the 168 Market, this small humble eatery provides a comprehensive array of Taiwanese breakfast items that elicit childhood nostalgia for many 1st generation Taiwanese/Chinese folks and are definitely on the must-eat list for those of us second-generation folks who have been fortunate to have made a pilgrimmage back to Taiwan (or as I like to call it, Foodie Island).  \n\nSoybean milk-  this is not the chalky stuff that you find in your supermarket that adds a nice dimension to your latte or cereal, this is enjoyed straight up either as a sweetened cold/hot beverage or in a savory form where a shot of vinegar and soy triggers a reaction so that the soymilk takes on a creamy custardization accented by little bits of green onion and pickled veggies.  For those with discernible palates, I've been informed by reputable sources that the soybean milk across the street at China Mama is superior.\n\nRice Ball (Fan Twan)- a classic item my parents used to grab on the go while heading to school, don't be fooled by the simple name.  This is steamed sticky rice enclosing a savory deep fried chinese doughnut and pork sung.  The ratio of the rice and filling is perfect and it's as classic a combination as pb and j.\n\nTemple meatball (Ba Wan)-  not sure if there are any other places in town that offer this, and fortunately they make a wonderful version of this popular street food item.    Finely chopped mushrooms, bamboo, and stir-fried pork encased by a glutinous tapioca flour bun and bathed in a thick orange sweet savory sauce that has an additional note similar to cinnamon/star anise, this one will flood your head with umami and makes me think if boba and dim sum were to conceive a rockstar child, this would be it.\n\nSpicy Beef Noodle soup-   Served piping hot and can easily feed 2 or more, the meat is impeccably braised and comes with garnishes of pickled mustard greens, cilantro, scallions, and bok choy.  Detractors might say it is on the oily side and is way spicy (in which case the version at Noodle Pot may be closer to your liking), otherwise this one punches you in the face and is not shy on flavor in the best way possible.\n\nLeek Pancake- A deep-fried empanada filled with garlic chives, scrambled egg, tofu, and mung bean noodles, this is a tasty rendition if you really like garlic chives.\n\nItems that have room for improvement include the savory chinese doughnuts (yiotiao) and the sesame bun (sao bing) which I found to be a tad bit on the dry side, and the hunk of pork in the pork bun (gua bao) is also a bit oversized and lacking unctuousness (Sheridan Su does a better rendition at Great Bao which is now Fat Choy).  Looking forward to trying the pork chop with rice, sweet tofu custard (do hua), and the lotus wrapped tamales (taiwanese and shanghainese varieties available) on future visits. \n\nNot sure if this is an outpost of Yi Mei Deli Co. in Rowland Heights, CA (the fonts on the food signs look similar), but if you're expecting the same level of quality, it may come up short since they set the bar extremely high, otherwise it's a great primer on Taiwanese cuisine for the uninitiated.

For those with discernible palates, I've been informed by reputable sources that the soybean milk across the street at China Mama is superior.\n\nRice Ball (Fan Twan)- a classic item my parents used to grab on the go while heading to school, don't be fooled by the simple name.  This is steamed sticky rice enclosing a savory deep fried chinese doughnut and pork sung.  The ratio of the rice and filling is perfect and it's as classic a combination as pb and j.\n\nTemple meatball (Ba Wan)-  not sure if there are any other places in town that offer this, and fortunately they make a wonderful version of this popular street food item.    Finely chopped mushrooms, bamboo, and stir-fried pork encased by a glutinous tapioca flour bun and bathed in a thick orange sweet savory sauce that has an additional note similar to cinnamon/star anise, this one will flood your head with umami and makes me think if boba and dim sum were to conceive a rockstar child, this would be it.\n\nSpicy Beef Noodle soup-   Served piping hot and can easily feed 2 or more, the meat is impeccably braised and comes with garnishes of pickled mustard greens, cilantro, scallions, and bok choy.  Detractors might say it is on the oily side and is way spicy (in which case the version at Noodle Pot may be closer to your liking), otherwise this one punches you in the face and is not shy on flavor in the best way possible.\n\nLeek Pancake- A deep-fried empanada filled with garlic chives, scrambled egg, tofu, and mung bean noodles, this is a tasty rendition if you really like garlic chives.\n\nItems that have room for improvement include the savory chinese doughnuts (yiotiao) and the sesame bun (sao bing) which I found to be a tad bit on the dry side, and the hunk of pork in the pork bun (gua bao) is also a bit oversized and lacking unctuousness (Sheridan Su does a better rendition at Great Bao which is now Fat Choy).  Looking forward to trying the pork chop with rice, sweet tofu custard (do hua), and the lotus wrapped tamales (taiwanese and shanghainese varieties available) on future visits. \n\nNot sure if this is an outpost of Yi Mei Deli Co. in Rowland Heights, CA (the fonts on the food signs look similar), but if you're expecting the same level of quality, it may come up short since they set the bar extremely high, otherwise it's a great primer on Taiwanese cuisine for the uninitiated.  Unbelievable value for your wallet but don't forget cash if you're spending under $10 and they accept visa/mastercard but no amex.

Everything was wonderful.  The brisket was sliced thin.. the ribs fell off the bone.. and the turkey was juicy and flavorful.  Potatoes and cornbread were good though they were just sides and my main focus was on the meat.  \n\nThe service was great.. our server Madison was very friendly and attentive.

Finally tried this place after knowing about it and driving by dozens of times.. Hopefully it won't be so long until my next visit as I enjoyed it quite a bit.  The smell inside this place is amazing..  I really had a tough time deciding what to get as everything looked and sounded really good.  Started with the fried pickles - quite tasty.  Ended up getting the 3-meat platter with the Turkey, Brisket, and Ribs - mashed potatoes and cornbread for the sides.  The food came out quickly as it was pretty slow for an early Tuesday night.  Everything was wonderful.  The brisket was sliced thin.. the ribs fell off the bone.. and the turkey was juicy and flavorful.  Potatoes and cornbread were good though they were just sides and my main focus was on the meat.  \n\nThe service was great.. our server Madison was very friendly and attentive.

Very good food. All is from scratch and fresh. Pierogi's are excellent. Serrol soup was new to me and was a pleasantly surprise in how great it tasted. Staff very friendly. If you are not familiar with Polish food, they are more than happy to share how it's made. Will be going back.

I've gone to the Wynn and Bellagio buffets, both which outshine this one.\n\nThey had unique pancakes, such as the red velvet and guinness pancakes, but otherwise lacked anything too noteworthy. I will say though that I enjoyed their small pans/platters of dishes, such as the guyere stuffed gnocchi and other tasty pastas. i woud have liked to see a bigger sushi spread though. \n\nOverall, it was good and definitely made me walk out full and satisfied, but compared to the other buffet options in Vegas, this wouldn't be my first pick.

I don't have much to say about this hotel because I wouldn't stay here again.\n\nHotel rooms-I stayed in the back tower and the walk to the tower was horrible. Walking through an entire casino with your luggage is the biggest pain in the ass, not to mention walking the bridge across the pool to get to the tower. Big thumbs down. Room was really nice, decor was nice, beds comfy, but bathroom was a motel 6 bathroom. Very old looking. Not what I would expect if owned by a hilton chain.\n\nCasino-casino was actually nice and fresh. Because it was newly renovated it smelled clean and didn't smell like a shit hole like some of the older casinos. Lots of options.\n\nAccommodations-pool was awesome, staff is nice, house keeping staff nice, but check in was a nightmare. Checked in at 2pm and line stretched to the casino. I was in the hilton honors check in and that line was in the casino as well. If it takes 30 mins for checkin, then you have already lost me as a customer that will not stay there again.

He jumped from one client to another. He started with my hair and did 4 other clients in between while I waited!! Finally he finished and I just wanted to get out if there. When I got home and took a closer look at my highlights, they were yellow. I asked if he used a toner and he said no. He didn't offer to tone my hair or fix the color. I had to go to another salon to have them tone it. In a matter of days my extensions (that Eli did) started to fall out. He told me to come back and he would fix them, which he did but in a matter weeks all my extensions fell out! So AGAIN I had to go to another salon to redo/fix my highlights and extensions.

If I could give this salon negative stars I would! I had the worst experience with the owner Eli! I went to the salon for highlights and extensions. I was at the salon for 6 plus hours! He jumped from one client to another. He started with my hair and did 4 other clients in between while I waited!! Finally he finished and I just wanted to get out if there. When I got home and took a closer look at my highlights, they were yellow. I asked if he used a toner and he said no. He didn't offer to tone my hair or fix the color. I had to go to another salon to have them tone it. In a matter of days my extensions (that Eli did) started to fall out. He told me to come back and he would fix them, which he did but in a matter weeks all my extensions fell out! So AGAIN I had to go to another salon to redo/fix my highlights and extensions. I asked Eli for a refund due to the poor job he did and the lack of effort in which he tried to fix my hair! I bought my own extensions which cost $400.  He charged me $400 but only offered to refund me $100! I had to threaten to take him to small claims court for him to only refund me $150. This was months later so I just took the $150.

Well since Yelp asked... My experience here was poor. I are here a year ago and had an amazing meal. Could not wait to check it out when I was in Vegas last week. Same meal was way worse. My steak was dry and flavorless. It was a huge disappointment. Since there are many steak options in this city. I wouldn't chance it if I were you.

Thought I'd give this place a try since it was near work and I love Thai Curry.  It was eh.  First, the soup was really bad, brown rotini noodles, brown broth, very unappetizing.  I ordered the beef curry lunch special.  Not much beef a TON of bamboo shoots, some sauce and fried rice.  The sauce was ok.  \nNext time I'm looking for Thai Curry near work, I'll search for somewhere else.

Maybe the wine bar has potential in nice weather...outdoor tables...overlooking The Intersection of Many Crashes. But it might be nice out there. Wine, with small plates? I met a nice young women working there one day...knowledgeable and pleasant. Not everyone up there gives off a positive vibe. Well I hope Kroger might use WF and EF for planning...atmosphere/selection/ethics.

We waited another unreasonabe amount of time for the check and a couple boxes for the leftover wings.

The manager \""Brooke\"" came to the table and I asked for an adequate box for our leftover wings and she said it's the rules not to give any more than the 1 tiny styrofoam box.  I could tell she wasn't the usual manager because she was dead set on passing the buck to the normal manager saying how they are even stricter with the rules than she is.  After I told her we are Tuesday regulars and she is clearly new to Tuesdays and lecturing her on how a good manager would handle things correctly without passing the buck and making the regular customer feel unimportant , she agreed to give us another tiny box.

Never again.\n\n#1 - I am a business traveler, and did not have a huge amount of time to sit waiting in lines for sub-standard service.\n\n#2 - Take a bus to the rental car center.  Then take another bus from rental car center to Fox location.  This tidbit of information was definitely not explained when I booked the reservations.  Expect an additional 45 minutes to an hour to take this into account on both ends of the rental.  Once I got onto the Fox bus it should have been a red flag when the driver immediately starts making excuses and apologies for his company.\n\n#3 - We show up at the rundown off airport/off rental car center/location. (For Sale Signs all over the property so I'm not sure how long these guys will be around.)  I get into line to get my rental car and the fun really begins.  14 people in line, 2 workers processing rentals.  Turn time per customer approximately 12 minutes.  Apparently their computer system was down.  15 minutes into the line wait and 1 of the 2 workers announces that he is going to take his lunch break.  He proceeds to collect his belongings and leave.  (In my business he could have collected his final check as he walked out the door.)\n\n#4 - Car was fine.  Honda Accord in good condition.\n\n#5 - Return process was outdated and slow.  Pull-in to leaving the location on the bus 32 minutes.\n\nThe 22% savings over Hertz was not worth the time and aggravation.

OK, so we ordered pizza for delivery and we made a mistake on our address, we just moved and have an incorrect apartment number.  After we realized our mistake we called pizza hut only to find out the driver had attempted to deliver the pizza but could not due to our mistake.  After calling the store and correcting our error we waited for our new pie to arrive. We waited, and waited and waited.  After more than an hour our pie was delivered and it was... Horrible!  I am confident that it was the same pie they attempted to deliver more than 2 hours ago.

Excuse me, can I have a Kleenex, cuz this Thai food is so amazing it's making my nose run.\n\nThat's how I love my Thai food. SPI-saaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!\n\nI have heard the rumblings of Le Thai and I just had to check it out tonight. I am writing this after eating the food (at home because you can get it to-go) AND having a lovely cocktail at their bar.\n\nFirst off, I had the \""Lady Boy Cocktail\"" concocted with what I have now discovered is a mehkong whiskey from Thailand. Um, why haven't I heard of this before? As a lover of whiskey this drink lifted me off my seatt and floated me into whiskey la-la land. It was sweet. But not too sweet. Yet, it gave me that delicious feeling only whiskey can provide.\n\nSecond - food! I ordered the Curry with beef at a heat level of three. I always like to \""test the waters\"" at new Thai places. Which means I go for the middle of the heat level. This level, for me, was ALMOST perfect. Next time I'll probably go for a 4. But that's just me.\n\nOh and by the way I got the chicken wings too. OH MAH GOD. How good were they? Not greasy. Perfectly cooked. Not too small, not too big. Oh and the sauce? PERFECT!\n\nGet your butt to Le Thai pronto.

Thought we'd give Bluewater another shot for sushi. Bad idea, I guess. \n\nLong story short, we wanted to eat lightly and ordered a few vegetable rolls.They weren't on the menu (they used to be, at $4 a roll) so I spoke with the sushi chef (not one of the usuals I see there) and asked him to be creative in whipping something up for us. We were served three boring, small (4 pieces including ends) rolls that were severely lacking in creativity or excitement. \n\nBill comes and we're charged for spicy tuna rolls at $8 a pop. Whaaaa? First, we didn't eat spicy tuna. We're told that's what they charge for vegetable rolls because they're not on the menu. Okay...but again, we didn't order spicy tuna, in fact we ordered the very opposite. And $8 a roll means we would pay $2 per PIECE of vegetable sushi. No way, man. \n\nIt was only after haggling with our server and two managers that we were able to have our bill reduced to a more appropriate price. Unfortunately, the whole experience sealed the deal on being totally over the place. \n\nAnd so begins the search for a new sushi joint... if anyone has suggestions for killer sushi (that includes creative rolls), I'm all ears!

Cherise is a great photographer, but is terrible at communicating and running a business.  My good friend had a similar experience and I see Facebook messages that are similar, so I know it is not just me.  Cherise does not respond to emails or phone calls. It could take up to a month to get an emai

Only giving it one star because the gals who work in the office were very sweet and tried to be helpful.  Having just moved here I needed a new place and thought I would give them a try.  My first thought as I walk into the lobby is it doesn't seem very professionally set up.  Seems cheaply decorate

As a freelance model, I'm always looking for fresh faces behind the lens. I came across Elizabeth's website and fell in love with her work. After synching up with her via pinterest and finding out that we have very similar tastes in photography, I reached out to her to line up a photoshoot! \n\nFrom the very beginning of our conversations, she was welcoming of ideas, very quick to respond to emails as well as being polite and funny. She came up with a great concept, and spent a ton of time getting the dresses, furniture and logistics squared away. During the shoot, she was overly prepared and had just about every little thing I would randomly ask for. Love that.\n\nElizabeth is extremely detail orientated; not only in her email correspondence but also during the photoshoot and post-production. She's a perfectionist and a professional with an amazing eye for great photography and I'm extremely grateful that I've had the opportunity to work with her!! Definitely looking forward to seeing what we come up with next...

My husband's fried fish banh mi had one seriously tiny piece of fish on it, and my nem nuong banh mi was similarly lacking in meat.  Their banh mi have never been especially generous in the meat department, but this time it was pretty sad.  It was mostly made of pickled veggies.  In comparison, Black Dog's sandwiches are about $8 ($3 more than most of the banh mi) and they're huge and come with a side.  I'd rather pay a bit more and get a better sandwich.\n\nTwo stars because the banh mi my sister got (creamy pork) was better and the service is always good.","I must confess, I am a Vietnamese Sandwich expert.  I don't use the word \""expert\"" lightly.  Unbeknown to me, my parents have trained me into being a Vietnamese Sandwich expert or a banh mi expert.  I know my banh mi.  In my household, this is like searching for the holy grail.  \n\nWhen I was grow

Every time my husband and I are in Vegas, we visit Chinatown for some Banh Mi. We often go to Mr. Sandwhich but decided to give Dakao a try. OMG their banh mi is soo good! They're bread is perfect. crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. the thickness of the bread is not to doughy either. The

Awesome family owned hole in the wall Vietnamese place near UNLV. Most people are probably iffy about going here just because it's in the sketchy shopping center with Von's because that sure did happen to me! However, do not let that stop you from trying the awesome food here. I always get the banh
