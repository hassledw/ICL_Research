2,0,"When I signed my lease they told me they recommend having the apt. sprayed for pests EVERY MONTH. The manger admits they have a roach problem and the pest control man told me as soon as it warms up the \""water bugs\"" meaning big roaches will show up. There is a pigeon infestation that is so bad when the wind comes up, there are feathers flying all over outside - it looks like you are inside a room full of birds. They poop on my stairs, entry way, live on my roof, near my air conditioning unit, feathers come in from the dryer vent. The pigeons sit in the dumpsters so when you put a bag of garbage in the dumpster, they fly up and get agressive and dustr and mites go all over the place. I get bit from bird mites when I go to get my mail. Have to wear long pants, socks and shoes to not get bit. My kitchen sink drains out in front of my apartment out into the parking area so there is always a stream of water there. I can see soap suds under the front of my building. Kitchen is a mess. Dishwasher opens across the two sinks, try putting dishes in when you have to move away from the sink, the refig is old and lopsided so the door won't stay open. Cupbards are so small I have to turn my dishes sideways to get them in. No linen closet, stacked washer & dryer with NO place to put laundry stuff. I contacted the manger because I have a bug infestation, which I showed the bugs to the police and they told me to contact the management and have pest control come out and find out what they are. Manager will not respond, I made second request in person in the office, still no response, now the management doesn't speak to me. My guess is several people got bird mites from the pigeon infestation so they are ignoring finding out if the bugs are bird mites. I lost my clothing and belongings due to it, am moving in 11 more days. Yes the view of the golf course is pretty, but the old men in the golf carts go right up to your bedroom and livingroom windows. You have NO privacy at all.I can hear my neighbors do laundry, shower. I fell sorry for the lady below me because I have to do so much laundry due to the bug infestation.",0
3,0,"La Promesa is a great bakery.  The empanadas here and at La Purisima are the best around, perfect flakey crust combined with delectable fillings.  Strawberry, lemon, apple, cherry, pineapple, all scrumptious and free of preservatives.  This place is great if your in the east side and can't get to La Purisima in Glendale, both shops are family owned and are of equal quality.",3
4,0,Vegans beware! My vegan friend was just informed that her request for a basic vegetable wrap would inconvenience the kitchen too much and that she should order the veggie burger which has tofu - unfortunately she's allergic to soy. Awkwardness ensued. Eventually they did give her a delicious veggie wrap.\n\nThe hummus was really good - the bread especially was delicious. You also shouldn't miss out on the cheese curds.\n\nI went with the crispy chicken sandwich and added guacamole which was absolutely the right choice. \n\nOverall a solid enough experience - there are definitely better burger joints in Madison but if you're here for Trivia (Thursdays & Sundays) or just to watch a game it's a great spot.,3
5,0,"Overpriced and under-fun. This was more trouble than it was worth and the \""crime scenes\"" were G-rated and boring. Probably OK for kids, but if you're over 12, skip it.",0
6,0,"My only complaint, truly, was that I found it to be a bit loud and so, once we moved to a sofa seating arrangement, I had a hard time hearing my friends who were sitting across from me. The music was great, just a tad too much on the side of I-am-not-involved-in-the-convo-because-I-have-no-idea-what-the-convo-is.\n\nAll things considered, however, it was fairly minor. At the bar, it wasn't as bad. Maybe that's the key? OK, got that bad news out of the way? Great, moving on.\n\nWe visited level 1.5 twice in one night... I am not sure what that tells you, but I can think of a few things. ;)\n\nThe service was superb (thanks, Brandy!), the drinks were strong (loved the slightly sweet, slightly bitter London Summer and the sweet margarita shot), and the other patrons were awesome. This level envelopes you in the chandelier idea and it's easy to forget  - supported by the amazing service and beautiful draped lighting - that you are in a casino. If I looked carefully (i.e. focused on what was outside the decor) then I could look down to the casino floor and see the clanging slot machines as a reminder (I couldn't hear them, big plus). I also love that the chandelier concept is layered... you can (whether or not you should is another story) thread your hands through the layers of strings that make this wonderful facade. It's just another detail to love, I think.\n\nThe layout is easy to navigate from level to level, seating is comfortable, amenities (read: restrooms and such) are easy to find, and the elevator as you move up and down the casino floors is fun to people watch from (and, to be fair, in).\n\nDefinitely on my \""let's hang out here\"" list. We drank well, smiled and laughed much, and generally had a fantastic time. Totally repeatable... often.",2

8,0,"I really wanted to like this place, I really did. It looked so cool and had a neat menu. I didn't mind the 30 minute wait for my table, but...\nFirst of all the place was absolutely chaotic! Servers, food runners and bussers running into each other. I watched a table get wiped down 3 times by 3 different people with a dirty cloth that smelled like a school cafeteria. There seemed to be no communication with each other bc everyone seemed confused. I ordered a juice which took longer than it should bc they have one juice area and it was crowded with servers. \nNow for what I really minded...\nMy food took about 35 minutes to come out and when it did, it was all wrong and tasted terrible. Hash browns are made in house but even after ordering them crispy, they came out wet and undercooked in the center. The only thing crispy was the outside. My eggs were ordered over medium but came out so undercooked. Just white slime on top. The sausage links are butterflied and you get 2 links instead of 3 like every other breakfast place. They obviously slice them so it looks like more. I didnt really mind that bc I can never finish 3, but I didn't like the taste. My English muffin was thick and doughy, not toasted. DISASTER! I just sent it back and asked for a pancake after they offered me something else. It never came...\nIt was a complete waste of an hour and a half that I could have had for holiday shopping!  The 2 stars are for the really nice hostesses up front",0

The Elvis and the Banana Cream Pie are every bit as delicious as they are beautiful.

10,0,"Come here if you want to be nickeled and dimmed. Just got charged $4 for two pieces of whole wheat toast that wasn't even properly toasted. Not a bread basket with jam and honey, oh no, 2 pieces of toast.  I can't believe I just paid $2 for a piece of bread. And if you want whip cream with ur $15 waffles it will cost you $2. Unbelievable, that an upscale place like this would do that. I get better service and tastier food in the diner in BK.",0
11,0,"This has been on my excel document of go to's for a long while now and was finally fulfilled last year. \n\nIt was dinner time and we took an elevator up to the level of the restaurant and once you get out, there is a hostess waiting for you. You see the kitchen immediately and the hostess brings you to your table. We didn't have to wait at all. \n\nJust as I hoped for, we got a table right by the window. Perfect view of the Bellagio and their water show. The only thing that ruined the view was cloudy sky. But I wasn't going to let that ruin my dinner.\n\nThe waiter was on top of everything and our glasses were never empty. I ordered the Baked Alaskan Halibut with vegetables and a side of potato gratin. I ordered the side because I had a feeling the portions would be small, but boy was I wrong. The fish was huge and the sauces so delicious. \n\nFor dessert we had the chocolate souffle, which I must say, is DELICIOUS! I still remember the sweet warm chocolate melting in my mouth. Ah, I'd definitely just return for dessert.\n\nThe only reason why I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is for one thing. When I took my first bite into my fish, there was a bone in it. And that's just not right. At least it was the only bone in my fish I found.",0
12,0,"My roommate and I decided to get pedicures on our vacation.  We tried to look up some locations and prices. We couldn't find many places that listed prices but ran across great reviews for the Qua Spa at Cesaer's on yelp and decided to make an appointment. It turns out that Qua is the spa and Color is the salon. We were a little disappointed because we wanted to see what Qua was like.\n\nWe were lead in and given mimosas. The place is very bright white and has a lot of marble. Allyn did my pedicure and was really nice and easy to talk to. The chairs have a great rolling massage option which was better than the typical vibrating chair massage. They also played fun top 40's which my roommate and I bopped along too as we joked around with our pedicurists. Allyn did slough off slightly too much skin because my toe had a tiny trickle of blood ( it's not her fault though, my feet are bone dry and prone to cracking, it also didn't hurt at all). Overall, it was a great experience. The only downside was the price- $100 for just a pedicure, but we figured we were on vacation in Vegas and just shrugged it off!",4
13,0,This place is great.  The staff is really friendly and the chile verde burrito is fantastic.  You know a mexican restaurant is good when most of the customers are hispanic.  I eat here for lunch three or four times a week.  Best cheap mexican food in Vegas.,3
14,0,"Where do I start, well, let me just make this short and simple....  We had ordered from them the delivery/ catering option to be delivered on the 24th for a Christmas eve party.    40 guests were invited, that's right 40, and would you believe it, they never show up!!!! I mean, no phone call, nothing, the plans  and evenings of 40 HUMAN BEINGS, customers, potential customers, WERE NOT FED and this is on CHRISTMAS EVE for a party, not that easy to just change plans.  And can you believe as the hosts how we felt, this was beyond something terrible, this was a Christmas Nightmare!!! This place was even called the day before at 2:00 to verify the order.  No excuses on this one.\n\n\n Places like this, who could even possibly do this to their customers, or fail to deliver in this fashion, there should be a law against this, this was just wrong, beware people, on just principle I would say this place in not worthy of ones business, after this incident, I am left speechless, it caused soo much stress and heartache, unbelievable...",0
15,0,"I decided to walk in here on a whim, and kinda regret doing so. The food could have been pretty decent, but it was -extremely- oily. There was a visible puddle of oil left after I scooped the meat and veggies out of the plate they were delivered to, and onto the rice. Outside of that it was fine, it was pleasantly spicy, and would have otherwise been mediocre Chinese food (I prefer thai in any case).\n\nThis is definitely a place geared for delivery. The internal appearance was very dingy, and as another reviewer commented, there are boxes and things sitting around out in the main area. The service wasn't horrible; it's not exactly sit down service; you order from a counter, but I -did- have the food brought to my table. \n\nHad the food not been so greasy (seriously, they could have used 1/4th the oil they did, which still would have been a little much, but certainly within the realm of 'okay' for my standards), and had the internal decor been a bit better (remove the boxes, ensure everything is clean and a bit better lit), and I could see giving this place another star or two...but as it was, I regretted going in.",2
16,0,"No wait for a Wednesday night which was nice and the food came out quickly.  Fish and chips were crispy on the outside and still cold on the inside.  Sandwich was ok, but nothing very impressive and definitely not worth the $9.99 price tag.  We sent back the Fish and Chips and it took a pretty long time to get the replacement meal we requested.  Not planning on returning ever again.  Service was quick, except for the replacement meal taking forever.",0
17,0,"Stopped by on our way home from Vegas. The food was good, I actually like their sauce better than Boiling Crab (LA). However, the waitress def could not explain the spice levels to us, they way she talked about the food made me not order as much as I normally do. She basically said the Cajun fries are too hot, and to order the mild sauce because the medium is too hot for her. This was after I told her I like spicy foods. I def could of gone for the medium sauce, and I probably would of tries the Cajun fries if she didn't dissuade me from getting them. Not a great way to sell your product! Would of given then 4 Stars but they made one of my friend chicken wings instead of fried shrimp, it took foreeverrrr for it to get corrected and they still handed is a bill with the chicken wings (their mistake). Would go back but they need to work on their service.",2
18,0,"When I first moved to LV, the new friends I made took me out to eat here.  I thought, chinese? Why not!  But when I saw the servers rolling carts around I was wondering what kinda restaurant this is.\n\nTHEY SERVE DIM SUM! It was my first time ever having dim sum and I had a good experience here.  I noticed the servers would mad dog you if you didnt want anything from their cart.  I found that funny.  They serve all the dishes a chinese restaurant would serve but they're honey walnut prawns are especially good.\n\nAlthough theres other places I would go first for Dim Sum, Harbor Palace is a good alternative. But then again, its in China Town, and other dim sum spots are close-by. =/",1
19,0,"I don't get items dry cleaned very often, so when I needed to have a formal dress cleaned, I wasn't sure where to go.  Even though I had coupons in my Bucky Book for three other cleaners, I decided to use Right Touch after reading the Yelp reviews (those other cleaners scored very low, and Right Touch scored very high).  \n\nMy dress had only been worn once, and it had a large dark stain on the front.  The dress was stored in my closet with that stain for over seven years!  I was not sure it could be cleaned at all.  But Right Touch said they would do their best, and they got it completely out!  The dress looks brand new, and I am thrilled!  Plus, the price was incredibly reasonable!  I will definitely use them again for any future dry cleaning needs!!",4
20,0,"Another quick lunch led me to this place. I headed straight to the drive-thru and ordered their lunch special: 4 tacos, a drink, and fries for $4.99. They get points for being quick (only waited about 5 minutes) and friendly. Unfortunately, that's about the best thing about this place. I ordered 2 carne asada tacos and 2 al pastor tacos. The tortillas were thick and gummy. The asada was dry and had little flavor. The al pastor was excessively greasy and the fries were forgettable. This might be good drunk food at 4 in the morning, but when you're sober... not so much.",2
21,0,"Took my husband to Vegas for a surprise 60th, and since deep dish pizza is his favorite meal, checked out the pizza places online and Amore sounded like a good choice. And it didn't let us down. :-)\nWe had the deep dish cheese with extra cheese, and we should have paid attention to the number of people it serves. We ordered a large, because we love pizza, and could only finish about a quarter of it. The thing must have weighed 10 pounds! A very dangerous meal, since you know you should stop eating it, but it tastes so good you just have to have another bite,and another, and another...you get the picture. :-)\n\nSince it was an estimated 25 minutes for the pizza to cook, we decided to have an appetizer. That was the first mistake of our visit. We had the eight piece serving of fried mozzarella triangles. The mistake was not because the mozzarella triangles were not good, they were very good, but they took up more space in the tummy that the pizza could've filled. \n\nAll leftovers were nicely packed up in containers for us to bring back to the hotel. Good thing we had a refrigerator in the room :-) \n\nThe restaurant has a sports atmosphere, clean tables, a lot of sports pictures around the room. Very 50s diner type atmosphere :-)\n\nWe were staying on the strip, so I would recommend visiting Amore if you're renting a car. We actually rented a car for a day (5/1/14) just to make the trip to Amore. The cab fare alone would have been more than the car rental, and that's not including the tip. (According to a web site that estimates cab fares, it was a $60 round trip fare from the Mirage hotel.)\nWill definitely do it again on our next visit back to Vegas :-)",0
22,0,"If you read my reviews in the past, I'm always writing a very positive and honest review.  Please don't be fooled when you walk in their store.  You will never have anyone come up to you to greet and to help you!  It's because, yes, they have what appears to be cool fish, but if you inquire, they'll sell you an illegal fish, too!  If I was able to give a zero star rating, I feel that would be a too generous of a rating for Trop-aquarium.  So let me expand on the facts I've experienced with this company.  First off Trop-Aquarium is the company that installed my 500 gallon fresh water tank which is built in a double sided wall.  The reason why we chose them was because they were less expensive than all the other quotes we received.  But in this case you really get what you pay for and less.  The reason for obtaining such a large fresh water tank was because I love large fish like big parrot fish and mainly an Arrowana.  We had 35 very large fish in the tank that we paid handsomely to Trop- Aquarium.  One Friday at noon 6 of our large fish died so because Trop- Aquarium maintained our tank, I texted, called and left a message immediately!  No response for a whole 3 days.  By now I'm frantically calling them because all 30 of my expensive fish had died.  Finally they pick up the phone and asked if I had over fed the fish, giggling and that they'll come in a day or two.  However meanwhile I, an unexperienced aquarium maintainer, was told that I need to remove all 30 dead corpses and to buy an airline with air rocks, 2 large buckets, tube everything properly, catch the remainder live fish, place them in the properly tubed buckets all at 12:36 am midnight.  They also offered if I don't know how to just leave the tank with only the dead fish removed, but I was sure all the live fish would've died by the time they came.  When they finally came days after, they realized that they had not glued down the returns.  So all the fish brutally suffocated before dieing.  The Trop-Aquarium technician cleaned the tank, drilled random visible holes in the Clear Vision tank to stick the airline pipe attached to the air rock that I had both purchased.  They verbally admitted to the installation error!  They then replaced our dead fish with 5 fish which were the size of a silver dollar.  Soon after their billing called us and said we owed them over $1000 for the work they did to fix the installation problem they created!  I contacted other aquarium builders and when they saw the tank, all six companies stated and agreed that no one ever would build a tank with no overflow mini tank and returns at the bottom.  Trop-Aquarium did this so that they would be the exclusive company to convert the tank, maintain it and also this way, they'd make a larger profit!  So, in conclusion, if you have limitless amount of money to burn,  want the cheapest specimen of fish in your fish tank, never want to get a timely response, and over all get scammed in the long run, Trop-Aquarium would be perfect for you!!!  Time is the true revealer of how a people are and how companies truly operate.  During my rough 5 year relationship with Trop- Aquarium, I come to realization that making $$$MONEY$$$ is their only priority and having a honest customer oriented business is NOT!!!!!  I WOULD NEVER WISH THIS EXPERIENCE UPON ANYONE ELSE!  You may have to pay a little more initially with another company, but in the long run over all, you will exceed a great amount of money you ever envisioned with Trop-Aquarium.",0
23,0,"I'm writing this review as I am about to embark on another LV journey with the girls.. A bit ago, me & j went on a LV trip- first time going with an other without a group of my girls (was sad they werent there!)\n\nTruth is, I dont really know how to gamble. I hate buffets. So for a person like me, i go to Vegas for the lavish hotels, morning mojitos, the tricked out pools, and the like. Encore provided just that. Anyone that has walked through Encore knows that the colorful interior with the mosaic tiles and slightly asian inspired (subtle) decor makes for sophisticated without crossing the line over to gaudiness.\n\nThe spa lounge area (can see it when one is crossing over to the XS pool area) is soo pristine- i wished my gfs to be there- they would have gotten excited about it more than J! The pool itself has two sections. One is directly connected to the spa and on the other side is the European style \""xs pool\"" - although we didnt see more than 3 brazen topless women, it was a big area for sunning and playing blackjack (same area they do at nighttime at the club)\n\n\nAs for the rooms, we had requested a \""quiet suite\"" since Encore is known to have loud music coming from XS at 4 in the morning.. so we got a north facing room.. Not the greatest view (just small strip plaza) but the King Suite (which is the smallest room at Encore I believe) was pretty spacious for 2 people.\n\nAnother thing- I dont know if anyone else notices but the music they constantly play in the casino is by Kaskade. I've heard at least 3 Kaskade songs during this stay and I remember hearing her 3 years ago when i was in this hotel as well- and i actually went home to look up who this artist was- and has made a permanent spot on my ipod playlist. For those that know of this artists work, it adds a serene element to the casino.\n\nOne of the only negatives to Encore/Wynn properties.. they are so damn far from everything else! We spent most of the trip at this hotel (except for the dinner/show which we cabbed to Bellagio- but the cab driver insisted taking some freeway looking road to get from Encore to Bellagio due to traffic ??)\n\nThey sometimes send deals over- one that i got in the mail which was 3 nights for 300 (incl weekends)- Except J threw it away and we didnt get to use it! So if you get one in the mail, take the offer! This place will be worth your stay.",4

29,0,"There are many other pasta places in town that I'd choose over Olive Garden. But they boyfriend had a gift card and free money is free money, right? The night before we ran a 5K, we decided to pay OG a visit and carb up. \n\nThere was about a 15 minute wait when we arrived on a Friday night. Looking around, there were plenty of tables opened, but I guess they were short on staff. A couple of booths were open at the bar area along with plenty of bar seating but we were never offered a spot there. We decided to wait it out. No biggie. \n\nOur server provided speedy service. No complaints here. They had a great deal going on: three course Italian dinner for $12.95.\n\nAppetizer: You can choose from unlimited salad or soup. I chose the salad. Your typical appetizer salad. My boyfriend got chicken gnocchi soup. This was alright. Gnocchi had a grainy consistency to it. But the soup was tasty. He finished the bowl. Hot and fresh breadsticks were also brought out. No sauce. Sauce is an extra charge. \n\nEntree: I got the three cheese ravioli. Your typical ravioli. I really wish I had hot sauce to give it some flavor. I should seriously carry a bottle of hot sauce in my bag at all times for this! Anyways, my boyfriend got the Penne di Mare. This is pretty good. Small pieces of shrimp with cream sauce over penne pasta. Apparently, scallops were supposed to be in this dish. I didn't see any, but the dish definitely had the scallop-seafoody taste. \n\nDessert: I got the chocolate mousse cake. Pretty darn decadent. I think this was the best part of the meal. But then again, I love anything chocolate. Give me chocolate and I'm easily satisfied. Boyfriend got the strawberry and white chocolate dolcini. This is way too sweet. Stay away. \n\nOverall experience was alright. We got what we came for (carbs, carbs, carbs) and left with a full belly. But the next time I come here will be only when I have a gift card to spend freely.",2

35,0,"Should chicken salad be white? Isn't chicken and mayo more of a tan color?  \n\nBut no, the salad was so white I thought I was being served a cottage cheese sandwich. The chicken salad lacked any texture, more like mashed potatoes, and hardly any walnuts. It was not a generous sandwich--the only other toppings I recall were lettuce and tomato served on non-artisan bread. \n\nI had remembered the Paradise Bakery at Metrocenter of years ago, okay many years ago, and was impressed with their food then. This sandwich was just okay and the Mediterranean salad was pretty good.\n\nThe parking here is limited and driving through the congested area is a difficult. I would hesitate to visit during the busy hours--there would be no spaces!\n\nSome pluses:  The atmosphere with brick walls, tall ceilings and booths (I love booths).  I liked the bright chunky plates. Their menu is extensive.

They will usually ask you if you're celebrating anything special when you arrive. If they know that you are, they make the night special by giving you a framed photo of your group along with a chef's choice dessert. \n\nJust a heads' up.

They couldn't get me into their place until a month later even though it was to be a diagnostic mammo and ultrasound in response to finding what I thought was a lump.  My husband said we couldn't wait and he called around and found that Breastnet could see us on Monday (this was on the Friday before the Monday).  We were thrilled!  I was too anxious to make it very long.  I was obsessing.\n\nBreastnet was FABULOUS!!!  They responded to how freaked out I was and were very supportive.  The technician was very sweet and helped calm me.  The Dr. was so good with me.  She told me as she did the ultrasound that it all looked good.  I was so relieved.  I squeezed her hand in joy and she was very friendly.  I highly recommend going here if you need to get your mammo and/or ultrasound as soon as you can.  Also, the atmosphere is very calming in general.  Thank you, Breastnet!",4

With every issue I've had, the maintenance staff has delivered.

45,0,This hotel had it's ups and downs. Checked in late on Friday night and the non-smoking room we requested was given away so we had to settle with a smoking room. They told us to come to the front desk between 12-3pm the following day to change rooms since they gave our room away so we agreed. \n\nNext day rolls around and after a great time at the pool and gym we called and they kept pushing back the time on when the room would be ready. We wasted 5 hours of our day not being able to leave and waiting for our non smoking room to be available. For someone who comes for the weekend and hours are limited it really sucks to waste time. Finally they gave us a non smoking room after complaining for 5 hours and sounding upset. It was a big disappointment. I'm giving three stars because that was an awful experience but the hotel itself wasn't too bad. The room we got upgraded and it was really nice. \n\nOn a positive light the hotel is in the middle of the strip and it's across the street from Cosmo and Bellagio. Had fun shopping and eating at Gordon Ramsey's Burgr place.,0

I always order a cali with all of my sushi because I find it refreshing, everyone knows that everywhere you go a california has crab avacado and cucumber. Well apparently not this place our roll came out and the sever fed us this line about how they were not putting cucumber in the roll anymore because it was cooked.............

The giant windows make it feel a bit as if you're in a fish bowl. And the noise- it gets incredibly loud.

52,0,Went on a Friday night....waited about 15 minutes for a table.  Longer than average time to get our spinach and artichoke dip app ($7) The lower price meant smaller portion of dip.  Ordered a grilled chicken sandwich tossed in their buzzed wing type sauce. ($9.99)  Entrees came in a timely manner.  Fries are good steak fries with seasoned salt on the table and a number of dipping sauces available.  I got my fries with the mayo/mustard sauce called campfire.  I should say I ordered my fries with it because when the fries arrived the sauce did not come with it.  By the time the sauce arrived the fries and wich were long gone.  I did use them on my second order of fries which came a good 10-15 minutes later.  Iced tea came pretty regularly.,2

54,0,"I've been to D'lish twice now (I wanted to give it a second chance before passing judgement). What I've found is that the food is pretty good but really over priced and they make horrible coffee & chai iced drinks! Both times I visited I ordered the California Club sandwich that has egg, turkey, bacon, pesto, tomato and cream cheese--it's pretty damn D'lish, but $7.95 is A LOT to spend on a breakfast sandwich!! Worth noting also, the first time I went there I asked for regular cream cheese instead of \""lite\"" they said sure...this time, the guy (who was pretty rude the whole time) said they don't have regular ever, only lite...there was no way I could have ordered it like that before!\n\nThe first time I went I ordered a dirty chai 32 oz (large) it was $6!! Yikes! AND, it tasted awful. I noticed when they were making it that they don't actually brew espresso or coffee, they pulled out a gallon of iced coffee from a fridge to make it that looked like something they'd purchased at a store \""iced coffee\""...the drink did not taste fresh and it wasn't in the least bit sweet. I actually had to add sugar when I got to work because it was unpalatable. \n\nToday, I decided to get an iced coffee with mocha. Well...again with the gallon of store bought iced coffee and then what appeared to be a big ol' tub of Hershey's chocolate syrup is what they used to pass this off as a \""mocha\"". Then, when I got the drink it wasn't sweet at all (again) I asked for a little more \""mocha\"" and by the time I got it back it was ridiculously over sweetened. To balance out the sweetness I stopped at Circle K and bought some milk (since, there iced coffee apparently do not come with cream nor do they offer it...I was in the drive thru...). By the time I got to work, put in my milk it was basically a big glass of chocolate milk! \n\nSorry, D'lish...but you're over priced and you couldn't make a good coffee drink if you tried...and you did...twice. I'm out!!",0

Each visit, it looks less like they sell clothes, and more like they're selling shelf space. \n\nWhat product they DO have isn't really that well maintained, either. In a typical retail environment, the employees at least PRETEND that they have product by maintaining the shelves and facing things to fill in the dead space.

61,0,"First yelp. Be kind. :)\n\nWas Friday lunch when a friend and I decided to try this local joint. It's located in a shopping center, next to the mega Lifetime gym in Gilbert. Easy to miss since it's tucked away in the corner but just know that it is in the same plaza as Zipps Bar and Grill. \n\nThe place was quaint, non pretentious, hybrid of a cafe and fast food set up, which is a casual place to relax and catch up with a friend. They have a couple patio sets out front to dine at as well. \n\nMost traffic coming in and out of the restaurant that day was for take out. The menu looked fresh and tasty. Their website is done well and was one of the reasons that got me here in the first place. Prices are good for the amount of food you get. \n\nI ordered the Spicy Chicken Wrap. It was the size of a Chipotle burrito but with much bolder flavors and a punch. It was filled with rice, black beans, chicken in a wonderful spicy sauce, jalapenos and other goodness that tasted really well together. Came with a side of yogurt sauce that helped balance the heat. Really was a great meal enveloped in a warm flour wrap. Couldn't finish the darn thing so let my friend have at it and he agreed to the tastiness. My friend got the Chicken Shawarama which I had a taste. Chicken tender, more fresh veggies so it is lighter than the Spicy Chicken, but still very well seasoned. It's wrapped in a Pita for easy enjoyment! For both, bill was about $13. \n\nIn all, great tastes, good prices, easy atmosphere. I would come back. \n\nOnly thing that I can dock on was that it was a tad bit slow to get our food considering we were the only ones there and no AC for first 15 minutes of sitting down but I had good company so its a minor critique.",4

64,0,"I've been here a few times since I moved in across the street about a year ago. Usually I'm in for a pedicure and I'm out. Their pedicures are decent, nothing special but appropriately priced. I've tried other places in the area because my brow lady that practices right next door to this place says the manicurists are treated like crud. Next time I'll take that more to heart, but I was in the area and needed a pedi so I stopped in again.\n\nI recently got into the gel manicure trend. I have had a few done at other places and decided to get one while I went in for my usual pedi. My manicurist, Debbie, didn't speak to me at all, even when I tried to compliment her technique. She also gave me a massage while my hands were in her hair which I was turned off by.\n\nThe polish on my thumb chipped the next day. I know this isn't the norm for gel manicures so I went back after work. The manager at the desk listened to my complaint and attempted to fix it herself.\n\nShe didn't remove the remaining (unchipped) polish and instead tried to file the remaining polish down to my nail. She then slapped more polish on. When she was done and asked for my approval I said it looked lumpy (it's a duochrome polish so the lumpiness is enhanced) and she attempted to fix it by putting on more topcoat.\n\nMy nail is still lumpy and I will not be returning.",0

We decided we were going to ask for a table at the bar and was informed that outside was open seating- this would've helped when we asked the first time but, whatever.\n\nOur server was not the sunniest bulb in the box, meaning, she was not friendly.  Gosh, I hate that and it put me in a bad mood.  Last time I checked, she was there to help us at her own will, not against it.  Geesh.  We all had a couple drinks and some of us had appetizers.  They were good but nothing to write home about.  Bar food.\n\nMy favorite part of the evening was when my friends rode the bull.

70,0,"Disapointed for breakfast. Pricey for the quality-there's much better breakfasts in this town.  THere were good things and bad things: \nGOOD:  1. Very well executed eggs benedict, with spinach.  Very subtle and elegant. Potatoes were perfectly salty and nicely crispy. \n2.  Pain perdu was wonderful with accompanying compote of cranberry which was not too sweet.  The creme fresche too.  \n3.  Great setting and decor.\n4.  Friendly service, if a bit lazy. Manager did not seem warm and welcoming. \nBAD: \n1.   Green tea was badly executed.  Maybe 3-4 grams for 400ML.  Temperature about 190.  That is terrible, and tasted terrible.  It was prepared with a paper tea bag-most tea drinkers know that paper tea bags leave residual bad flavors, and this one did.  Green tea is supposed to be executed between 150-180.  3-4 grams should be about 120-180ml. \nWaiter insisted that the second green tea was called \""crocetia\"" a Japanese tea.  I told him that I didn't believe there was any such Japanese tea, and asked him to bring the bag over.  He refused at first, and insisted that it was indeed Crocetia.  He  later did bring the bag.  It was not crocetia but kokeicha.  I didn't know if it was \""formed\"" tea or \""twig\"" tea, so I decided not to order since I was getting a pretty typical Quebec \""I don't know and I'm not going ot find out experience\"".  The genmai cha was week, tasted bad and smelled funny.  The manager had to be told to take it off the bill despite my telling him the tea was bad.  Also a typical Quebec experience. \n2.  The smoked salmon was supposedly made by an artisinal smoked salmon maker.  They need to find a better one.  Lemeac has much better salmon with real character.  Lawrence as well.  Both make their own.  This is a high end place and this salmon tasted almost as though they were trying to replicate a salmon that people who frequent ordinary delicatessens in New York might like.  It's color and texture were disapointing.  there wasnt' the firm waxy smoothness or the smokiness of a good Scottish or Norwegian style salmon.  It tasted like cheap deli nova which in NY mostly comes from the same provider.  It is too soft, a strange color and lacks firmness, smokiness and good flavoring. \n3.  Presentation-great except for a pooling of grease on our plate under the potatoes. \n4.  Didn't offer additional coffee-had to ask for my wife who had said, \""maybe they charge for additional coffee\"".  \n5.  No bread provided-perhaps you have to order it and pay for it.  \n6.  Prices were high and the product was not as good as other less pricey restaurants for breakfast.\n7.  Manager had to be asked to take the tea off the bill-seemd a little testy about that.  Should have offered when I cgave him my comments.  Did not.  That is unacceptable in a restaurant like this.  \n8.  Bagel was hard and dry. \n9.  Cream cheese was nothign special.  Tasted almost like store bought Philadelphia brand, though it was grainier.  \n\nI think maybe Daniel has too many restaurants.  Ramsay has the same problem. If you come to Montreal, you better make sure your staff is not carrying around a lot of Montreal service habits.",0

Then I arrive the next day, only to be told by the front desk that due to security reasons they can't issue me a key.

79,0,"The boss was heading to a diner today for a lunch meeting, and being already tired of my leftovers for the week, my mind starting thinking of diner Reubens, and I had a craving that had to be filled.\n\nI googled 'Reubens' and 'Strip District' and a few dining establishments that have vanished from the Strip District, but not from Google, popped up.  The one that was current was the brand new Car Hops, citing 'Reuben' on the menu.   So, since the Strip offerings really are limited when you work there, I decided to go for broke and fulfill the craving while trying out the new place on the block.\n\nI had heard a few 'meh' reports from co-workers who tried it once, but was really set on a Reuben.  So I went in, and found it on the menu (at $12.50) and pretty much indeed DID go for 'broke' for a lunch sandwich.  \n\nThe burly tattooed man behind the counter 'warned' me that it was huge, and I replied with a 'this is a test, we'll see.'\n\nWhen I travel to NYC, say for a long weekend, four out of my six meals will probably be Reubens, because it's the one place (seemingly) on the planet, where you can get a SUPERB Reuben anywhere they serve a Reuben.  I think it's NY law.  And I DO love a good Reuben.\n\nI placed the order and paid, and then waited about fifteen minutes, and the gal behind the counter brought it out to me in a styro container in a bag, and I walked it back to the office.  It had a good weight to it, and I was encouraged.\n\nI sat it down on my desk, pulled the styro container out of the bag, and popped it open.  It WAS huge...it filled the entire container, and it did look pretty darned good.\n\nBut then I sat down with my soda and a few paper towels and started eating it.\n\nBREAD!!!\n\nRye bread, that was very possibly more than a full inch thick - a kind of Texas Toast thickness...TONS of sauerkraut and thousand island sauce that made it squishy...but a little light on the meat and cheese.  \n\nMy co-workers had also commented on the bread being a bit too much and the contents being light in what they'd had...why I didn't listen...I don't know.\n\nHonestly kids...do NOT try to dupe me with a loaf of bread with no stuffing...I'm hip to the jive.  What was inside that loaf of bread was not worth the $12.50 price tag.\n\nThis was another FTLT visit.  \n\nAlthough, I must admit - while I waited for the sandwich to be made - someone at a table had ordered cheese fries, and they did look awfully good.  They were real potato fries, but they were smothered in that gooey orangey fakey cheese sauce, which to ME is what sinfully delicious cheese fries are supposed to be all about.\n\nI 'might' go back and try the cheese fries - at $3.75 for a healthy sized basket, that might be a worthy splurge lunch.  \n\nBut I won't be going back for a Reuben - or any other loaf-o-bread sandwich.  \n\nYou don't eat a Reuben for the rye bread.  It's all about the meat and cheese - with the sauerkraut and thousand island dressing being VERY secondary, only there for flavor.\n\nAnd that goes for any other sandwich - it's all about the filling - not the wrapper.",2

81,0,"This place used to be good... About a year or more ago. It seems to me they have changed ownership or management or something. The food quality is bad now. They have a menu item that has a bunch of bacon. The bacon used to be crispy and thick not it couldn't be more thin and under cooked. They give you a huge plate with two items on it and it makes it look like they forgot part of your meal. I've tried everything here. Nothing is good. \n\nI had the sausage and hash browns. The hash was undercooked (despite asking for it to be crispy). The sausage was cold. Seems they put it onto the griddle frozen and it didn't cook all the way or something. The pancakes alone are okay. The thing about pancakes, waffles and French toast are they are only as good as their syrup. Well the syrup is the cheapest tasting syrup substitute I've ever had. You can taste the sugar/ corn syrup in it. It has no smoky or mapley flavor to it (not even fake flavor). \n\nService is fine. Nothing to get excited about. Maybe 3/5 stars. The food is just so horrible that it brought the rating down that much. \nMy family and I have decided we will not return unless there are no other options. My warning is just because you had it before doesn't mean it is close to the same. I mean there wasn't even a piece of orange or parsley or melon on my plate like there usually is when you order breakfast at any other breakfast place",0

Terrible decision because their bbq sauce and chicken are awful, but the crust is so terrible it wouldn't really matter what was on top of it.  \n\nSo I called in to possibly get a different pizza sent out and I got to talk to Jack.  Maybe he is a cook trying to act like a manager but he certainly lacks any sort of customer service skills.  His offer to me was half off a new pizza.  Half off a pizza that I paid extra for, which I was ok with only to find out the bbq chicken pizza is only sauce, chicken and cheese.

You get a bad tip.\n\nWe ordered some sangria, the red, which was alright but not great. Then we ordered a few plates of tapas, to get us started. We had the risotto which was just terrible and a few other things as well. The only good thing was the ceviche, but I've certainly had better. It was a tiny bit of food for a lot of money and a lot more attitude.\n\nThere are much better options out there. I will not be back.",0

The reason I give 3 stars is because that deal isn't valid for people with memberships!? I learnt this 30 seconds after paying for a membership. I'm a student and could have paid $2.75 for movies twice a week. Instead I paid $40 (way too much) for a membership to pay .75 cents less than the other students.  Good movie selection and shop but don't fall for their rip off of a membership unless you rent daily.,0

The shop girls follow patrons around, but do not offer assistance unless asked, at least during our visit, perhaps there are a lot of thefts in the store that justifies this odd practice.\n\nStore mascot, Odie McMuffin, a mix breed dog was one of the highlights of the visit.",2
95,0,"Possibly one of the worst sushi restaurant's I've ever been to. A small group of friends and I went in and asked to sit at the bar. Well, actually we put our names on a piece of paper. No greeting from the employees, just a silent, wait your turn kind of atmosphere. We knew we probably wouldn't sit together (the restaurant is VERY small and they only utilize half the space), but we figured maybe a spot would open up. We sat down to wait and a party of three walked in. They were seated almost immediately. We tried to ask the waiters what had happened, but they put their hands up repeatedly and continued as they were. We gave them the benefit of the doubt and patiently waited our turn.\n\n20 minutes later two parties got up from their seats leaving six bar seats open in a row. We were so happy! We promptly stood up knowing that we'd be seated next. The owners then seated a party of two that had come in after us in the spots that should have gone to us. We asked to speak to the manager who explained to us that they don't seat \""large parties\"" at the bar. We reminded her that we were totally okay with being separated, but she stuck to her ridiculous rule of not seating us.\n\nSo here we are, 25 minutes later with no communication letting us know that we were waiting to sit at a table. We asked them to seat us in groups of 2 or individually and the owner continued to explain that we were not welcome at the bar due to our party's size despite that we would all be paying individually. At this point she became hateful and manipulative. She crossed our name off of the top of the hand written list and added our names underneath all of the parties that came in after us. We were so upset that we up and left. We received no customer service (or even interaction) and were treated like an annoyance. If you want to give your money to an entirely rude and spiteful establishment for the sake of a gimmick, go right ahead but I will never be returning.",0
96,0,"I have visited this store several times beause I want to look cute while pregnant. I was excited to see they carried maternity versions of brands I normally wear, but buyer beware! I bought a pair of Sanctuary Pants (over $100) and the first time I washed them the buttons fell off! I washed them on cold, gentle cycle, inside out (our washer is the kind without an agitator) and didn't even dry them. I have several pairs of Sanctuary pants that are not maternity and worn them for years without issue. Everything I have purchased were top dollar desinger brands and they don't wear like their non maternity counterparts. And watch out for the \""FREE\"" Parenting Magazine they want to sign you up for. We got charged $20 for it on the credit card we used for one of our purchases without being notified.

The bacon wrapped water chestnuts have gone down in quality significantly over the years: burned bacon, smaller chestnuts, and dry dry dry.

We requested water and tea, and in my water cup and all around it were white residue from a previous mixed drink of another customer. I had already drank half of the iced water and realized there was all over the sides of the cup. I immediately asked for a replacement and even the server was grossed out! They did not do anything to compensate for such a gross encounter, which in the end made everyone at the table lose our appetites. Seriously... traumatized. Definitely not coming back until their service improves!",0

I had the bangers and mash, the wife had the chicken tikka masala. We loved each of them, and believe me that one pasty is enough to satisfy a big appetite.\n\nWe were not as huge fans of the fries/chips. Also, the waitress really had no idea about any of the beers on the menu. Since I am not knowledgable about British beer, this led me to order something I didn't really care for.

I was out with my meat eating sister and my pescatarian husband so I figured this place would be the best for all three of us to get what we want. \n\nWe get in and I ordered a burger that wasn't the Streamliner (1st mistake), and just ordered it with the BOCA burger. The waitress takes our order, my husband also ordered his with a BOCA. \n\nAbout 20 minutes later the food comes out. The patty looks right. I was a little apprehensive and I should have gone with my gut feeling on not eating here this day, but I ignored it. It had been awhile since I had eaten a BOCA patty (over a year), so I THOUGHT it looked right. (2nd mistake)\n\nI start eating it and about half way through it the bill hits our table. It was crowded in there so the waitress must have been trying to get us out of there. So I look at the bill and notice both my husband and my burgers say Turkey substitution. I immediately start to freak out. We call the waitress over and explain to her that we ordered BOCA, why does it say Turkey? She then tells us that it is BOCA it just says turkey. I say, no that doesn't sound right. So she goes to talk to her manager I guess because we never saw her again. The manager comes over to our table and apologizes profusely for what happened. I'm upset because how the hell do you confuse BOCA and Turkey? I mean, really. I know some people might think how did I not know the difference. And I thought that to myself as well, but the truth is it slipped by me even though it shouldn't have. And it hurts me every time I think about it. I will never come to this Johnny Rockets again, if any of them ever again because of this experience. \n\nAll I can say is, if you are vegan or vegetarian, and you go to any of the Johnny Rockets, make sure that your waitress/waiter knows that a BOCA burger isn't meat. Stress that to them. Because obviously they aren't trained to know what the difference is.",0

The family style is a great way to enjoy the meal.  They provide a lot of food for their prices.\n\nWe started with the potato soup which relly jump started my apetite.  It's rich, creamy, and flavorful.  Next up was the Beef Braciole.  This dish was quite interesting.  The texture was weird yet it was edible (may have been my hangover dulling my senses).  I can't quite remember the name of the next dish, but it was a spicy spaghetti and meat balls, I believe.  The spiciness brought back all my senses and pretty much kicked me out of my intoxicated state.  You can never go wrong with spaghetti and meatballs.  We also had the Rigatoni \""D\"".  The chicken was tender and the protein gave me energy for more partying.  \n\nThey gave us enough food to take back to the hotel and have for dinner.

107,0,"Came back for dinner on a Sunday night - the place was WAY less crowded then it was when we first visited.  Could be that it was not a popular day to go out to eat, or that the excitement of the grand opening has died down, or it could be that we came during the Steelers/Jets playoff game and everyone was at a bar somewhere.  Whichever.  It was quieter, in a good way.  They have a full bar now, and the TVs were playing the game, not Bollywood movies.\n\nWe got the buffet, which I think was about $10.  They had a pretty good selection of things - several vegetarian offerings (aloo gobi, chana masala, potatoes in spinach, paneer in tomato sauce), and chicken tikka masala, tandoor chicken, goat biryani, spicy chicken wings, and various other things.  Also two soups, a little salad area, a handful of condiments/chutneys, and a few sweet dessert-ish things.  And naan.\n\nEverything was pretty good - on the lukewarm side, as per usual for a buffet, but I appreciated the wide variety of options.  It was a good deal for the price.  Still, I think the quality (and temperature) of the food is higher when you order off the menu.  Nothing wowed me enough to bump them up to a four-star review.  it was standard Indian buffet fare - tasty, well-priced, all the usual suspects.

At that time it was in a much smaller space, but within the last year they have relocated to a much nicer location.  \n\nThe sushi is phenomenal!  The best I have had in the valley, and I have tried many.  The rolls are to die for - large, flavorful, fresh and they never skimp on portion size or taste.  The staff is attentive and friendly.

This made me excited because I love all of those places.\n\nOnce we were seated, I realized that all the tables were so close together even though the restaurant wasn't even packed. Generally, I like the brewhouse feel. I was so excited to try the housemade root beer here. It's funny because I usually hate root beer but after trying Chicago Brewing Co.'s housemade stuff, I am so intrigued to try housemade root beer. To my disappointment, all of their drinks tasted like heavy syrup in each one. We got Strawberry Lemonade, Peach Iced Tea, and Homeade Root Beer. All of them were vigorously stirred and still tasted way too sweet. We ordered Tapas for appetizers. You can never really go wrong with Olive Tapenade and that's what I stuck with. It was good. For food, there was steak tacos, some flatbread stuff?, and veggie pizza. According to my friend, steak tacos were meh. Flatbread had no flavor. Veggie pizza was decent.

I liked this feature of Arclight in LA since I always had preferred seating and didn't have to wait an hour for some of the top flicks to get a decent seat. The movie we were watching didn't have a time close enough for a reserved seats showing, but it's definitely something to consider in the future. Now if they would only start doing certain viewings no kids or no teens, and alcohol served I might start going to theaters out here more often. \n\nSo far though, I think I'll come back for the comfy reserved seating on popular movies over going to a smaller theater closer to home.",2

We ordered Beef Brisket, mashed potatoes, beans, and corn on the cob. \n\nThe mashed potatoes were not only fake \""boxed\"" tasting but also tasted old and completely flavorless. I think they may have been yesterday's leftovers from a local nursing home. If you're going to serve up mashed potatoes from a box, spruce it up a little bit, maybe add some salt or garlic?\n\nThe corn on the cob was tough and chewy.\n\nThe beans were okay, nothing notable about them. I suppose it would be difficult to irreparably mess up beans.\n\nThe beef brisket................dry, gamey, and tough. It was actually difficult for me to swallow it down, that's how gross it was. For the record I am NOT a picky eater. The meat was sickening and I almost felt like I wasn't actually eating beef, but perhaps a local stray dog or some kind of rodent meat. It didn't even taste like beef. \n\nHad we not used the Groupon, we would have asked for our money back and left. I do not recommend this place and we will definitely not be back. I'll stick with Dickey's, Dillon's or Honey Bear for BBQ, or anywhere but Bubba Phatz for that matter.",0

Upon walking in I immediately notice it is a tad smaller compared to the other popular joints in town.  It wasn't busy at all because there were 2 tables with customers, which worked in our favor because our food came out within 10-15 minutes. We ordered batchoy, some type of crispy house special noodle, sauteed shrimp, fried flounder, and salt and pepper pork chop. The batchoy was kind of whatever wish we would of ordered a tastier vegetable dish, the noodles were good, but I was not in awe, sauteed shrimp was accompanied with onions and green peppers, but the onions made up 75% of the dish and the dish overall was okay. Fried flounder was crisp, but another \""okay\"" taste as well. And most places don't mess up salt and pepper pork chop. Food was between okay and good, but I have definitely had better. On the plus side the service was good for a Chinese place because our server Jing gave us all our needs.

I ordered the popsicle that I had heard so much about. They said they were out of them but would give me a vanilla cone and I could put the toppings on it. I was served  two scoops of ice cream in a waffle cone. There were three small bowls with it. In them was chocolate pearls, chocolate sauce and something I couldn't identify. I think it was browned coconut. I wasn't impressed at all. The chocolate was to fancy for me I guess. If I'm going to pay $8.00 for an Ice Cream cone I would like it to be more spectacular.

Montreal's are thinner and somewhat sweet, which is less enjoyable to me.\n\nThat said, some of the dozen bagels sold to me were actually stale and had to be day old.  The best and freshest was probably the sesame.  However, we decided after trying both St. Viateur and Fairmount, that Montreal bagels are not for us.  I think many Americans who have experienced high-quality bagels in NYC might agree.

Perhaps a dinner might be better; I got the sense that they were still prepping for the evening, so lunch is whatever they have on hand.  They were out of curried goat.  They didn't have enough of the oxtail to make up my meal, so they gave me what they had and added some stewed chicken.  The beef patties were commercially bought ones - very disappointing.  I'd hoped they made their own here.\nOverall, flavors were average.  The sparse caribbean restaurant options in Phoenix gives this place a pass on the flavors - it's better than not having any, but nothing to write home about (at least not the lunch I had).\nThe owners are friendly, and the place is relatively clean (tables a bit sticky, however).  \nI really want to like them, so I'll give them another try - this time a dinner when I'm in the neighborhood.  Perhaps go with the more traditional roti and curry goat.... IF it's available!  Reserving judgement for now.....",2
126,0,"I came here for a birthday, where we had booked a private room overlooking the castle. It was \u00a324 for 2 courses (alcohol not included). The menu sounded promising: the results a little more than disappointing. The cod starter was fine, the venison main was basically a stew that had hardly any venison in it, and tasted like it had been made with Bisto. It would have worked out at about \u00a318 for the main and \u00a36 for the starter -\u00a0which was completely over priced, both for the quantity and quality of food.\n\nThe staff were patchy -- some were lovely, others seem harrassed and annoyed any time you stopped them to ask for anything.\n\nThe table was also too wide to allow natural conversation to flow across the table. I had lovely company for the evening, but it did mean only talking to the two people on either side of you for the duration of the night, rather than mingle a bit more. Narrow table would have been good to allow cross-table conversation too. A few smiles and waves were given!\n\nIt was a nice venue, good view of the castle, but the food wasn't just forgettable - it was disappointing and felt like a waste of my money. I wouldn't book it myself for a private event.",0
127,0,the food is really great good drinks  but terrible atmosphere the music so loud the waiters cant even hear you i work in clubs and their music is alot overpowering than anywhere ive been not good i understand the loungy feeling they want to put out but not to the point its uncomfortable i had their foie gras french toast which was amazing and i think i tried mac and cheese too i ended up leaving and sitting outside and had my meal packed to go i couldnt take the music and i got a migraine. they could do better. the food is amazing but i would never come here again for the sole purpose of the environment. we did ask the waiter if they could lower it a tad bit but if they did it was highly unnoticeable,0

129,0,"Quality you can count on!  \n\nI'm sure this slogan is being or has been used by someone else, but it rings true at this establishment.  \n\nBeing an espresso drinker, I've tasted bad, burnt, awful espresso, here's looking at you Charbucks, but Central Coffee is none of the above.  Their espresso is rich, fresh, clean, satisfying and rivals the best I've ever had (Caff\u00e9 Ladro).  On occasion I'll get the \""Shorty\"" which has one shot, frothed milk, and a shot of vanilla; it's a great drink when I'm looking for something different but still want the pick me up.  Stop by on the weekend (8-12) when they offer a hot out of the oven veggie quiche and breakfast casserole; I'll vouch for the breakfast casserole.  And don't miss out on their Wednesday pound coffee deal, 15% off each pound purchased.  Stop throwing your money away on convenience (Starbucks) and try something new and something your taste buds will appreciate CENTRAL COFFEE, you won't regret it.",4

It was seriously amazing, and my very first black bean burger! I will return to eat, because I saw a few things at other tables I wanted to try. Let's hope we get a more welcoming greeting, and our server doesn't act like we've interrupted her day.\n\nAnyway, the food was awesome! The girl I went to lunch with liked her food, too!

132,0,"Good god, after two trips I can say there is maybe two things on the menu if we were to return i would order. One is an appetizer and the other is a side.  The ahi poke salad and the plantain bananas.  Everything else I have tried as far as the bowls go were absolutely gross in my opinion. I couldn't even stomach the ahi bowl and I LOVE ahi! So i pushed aside my bowl not wanting to tell our waiter i was absolutely disgusted with it since i think thats just rude to say that and omg my poor sister who is a vegetarian wasn't very hungry ordered a side of mac and cheese and said it was the WORST mac and cheese she has ever ate.  I would have easily said something to the waiters about her food since shes my baby sister and as skinny as they come i would tell her to stop playing with it and to let me say something but she just picked up maybe a noodle every  5 min and put it back down.  I would have thought the waiter would have picked up on our lack of interest in our food with completely full bowls but obviously no S**t's were given.  Nice to know hula Nice to know.",0
133,0,i would never ever recommend them to anyone ever! first lets start with i only had my braces for 7 months. i have seen them every single month and has a payment every single month. back in may when i had my rubberbands changed they told me i was a month behind come to find out they applied my payment to a general payment and i never had any general work done! they said its from xrays they took when i asked them before they started anything will need to repay for xrays because if so i can have my general dentist send over my xrays since i just paid to have some done a day prior to my braces consultation i was told no i dont have to pay its included in the free exam. i call today and they tell me im 285.00 bucks behind and they will not apply one of the payments i made to the ortho account because i was charged for xrays then told me that i have only paid 3 payments out of the 7 months i have had it and thats not true because had i not made those payments they would of damn sure made me pay them before i got any work done. corporate is rude and the office staff sucks. they can do what they want with that contract because i will be taking my business somewhere else and i will be also filing a complaint with the bbb right along with everyone else that has! straight fraud! and whats even worse! my brackets keep falling off! but they want to harass you for payments but cant fix your teeth right! a bunch of losers! dont go to western dental this is a warning they are a bunch of rude scame artists!,0

136,0,"A friend and I were going to have lunch at Paul's Pel'meni today.  After seeing the lack of sanitary food handling by the lone employee, we decided to eat elsewhere.  Getting a case of gastroenteritis was not on my \""to do\"" list.\n\nI watched the employee handle greens and other food items with his bare hands.  I then saw him take a few orders, handle the cash, use the credit card machine, and answer the telephone.  He then went back to handling the food with his bare hands without washing them.\n\nMy friend and I were at the restaurant at 1PM on a weekday.  There were only a few people in there and only one person working.  With such an appalling  lack of sanitary food handling, I can see why there were so few customers.

The regular is quite large and the other size is enough for three people.\nThe club had plenty of meat on it.\nIt was difficult to tell the difference between the white and wheat sub rolls, but they were not bad.\nThe most interesting thing was the cups the drinks come in.  There are several different cups with the stories of various Jersey Mike's that have done fund raising for feel good causes.

One can almost sense the calculated, committee-approved decision making that dominates the theatre. \nThe concession stand and gourmet coffee bar must seem amusing to Europeans. The seating area has little ambiance and is certainly not a place I'd spend any time hanging out. Boring.\nThe theatre I viewed the film in was serviceable, but nothing outstanding comes to mind.

She really helped me get everything together and I could not have done it without her.  \n\nWe chose this location based on a couple of things.  \n1.  SW would not accommodate a party our size \n2. We have eaten here before and liked the food, although the service left something to be desired\n3. It's a beautiful space in a beautiful hotel\n \nThe menu we chose was their priciest at $150.00 pp.  Mostly everything was great but there were some misses.  Our menu consisted of... \n\n*Antipasto including iberico ham, manchego cheese, marinated olives & bread -  this was a hit.  everything was delicious\n\n*Black Truffle Arancini -  Delicious and they went fast\n\n*Whipped garlic feta cheese with mushrooms and bread - Could have skipped it\n\nShellfish Platters - made up of the largest shrimp I have ever seen, lobster tails, oysters and Alaskan king crab legs.  These were awesome.  everything tasted fresh and great.  Nice portion for everyone at our table\n\nSalad Course was good, tomatoes, garbanzo beans, peppers, manchego \n\nKing Crab Risotto -  This dish was very rich and very tasty.  the risotto was perfectly cooked.\n\nOur entrees consisted of \nDover Sole - my guests who ordered this said it was OK and wished they got something else.  It was not prepared properly\n\nFilet and Lobster tail -  the filet was perfectly cooked as were the lobster tales but the tales were tiny.  I mean baby lobster tiny.  Still very good though. \n\nBone in NY Strip - The steak itself was very good, however, our guests did not get a choice on temperature.  So most were very rare.

142,0,"We dined here this evening with my daugher's dance studio being located in the same plaza.  We were both super excited to get a Greek place nearby and had waited anxiously since we saw the signage up prior to opening.  It was pretty disappointing, I am sad to say :(\n\nWe had to wait about 5 minutes at the counter to place our order and finally, I think one of the owners, came over to assist us in our order.  We waited almost 40 minutes for one gyro plate and one souvlaki plate although they did bring out soup samples to all the tables which was very thoughtful.  The gyro was nothing to write home about, the meat on the top of the pita was very very crispy, crunchy in fact which oddly enough, added a pleasant texture.  The sauce was standard and was just the right amount.  The rice was a STANDOUT....super fluffy but in need of a little more seasoning.  My husband's souvlaki pita was tasty, the meat was lean, moist and cut in perfect sizes for the wrap.  Fries were standard with a slight sprinkle of parmesan and parsley.\n\nDeco was a little weird...........a map of Manzanillo Mexico in a Greek place was a little weird not to mention the Asian/Chinese art on the tables.  Television was quite loud and obtrusive, maybe a little mood music would be a better choice at night.  The service was really slow, they have been open a couple weeks now so maybe they are still getting the feel for the layout.  It was super clean, a positive for me :)\n\nI may go back in at lunch time perhaps to try out another dish.  I am really hopeful that they are able to maintain and stay open as every other establishment in this corner has closed previously.",2
143,0,"I went yesterday with my friend, having bought a groupon that covered the session fee, hair, makeup, a dvd slide show, and one 8x10.  The appointment was easy to make, and they called to confirm 2 days before the appointment, which is always appreciated because sometimes you forget.\n\nThere is one viewing area, where they can do one session at a time, towards the front.  It is not private, so if you are doing boudoir photos, I hope you're not exactly shy.  There's a partition up to shield it from the passing public's view, but there's no privacy if someone comes in to book an appointment, or even just stands in the hallway.  Not many people want to do boudoir photos and have them easily viewed by everyone that passes by.  The area in the back could have been set up as an additional viewing area, it would be more private, and cut down on waiting times.\n\nThere is only a set of curtains that is used when a session is going, and I witnessed a family passing by, and their child peeking in on people.  Again, I hope you're not shy!\n\nThis business needs a THOROUGH scrub down.  There was debris from different props all over the ground, the floor was scuffed up and dirty (and they expected you to sit on it in your panties if you were doing boudoir photos), there was a musty smell about the whole place, I can only imagine what would come up from the carpets in a proper cleaning, and the bathrooms were absolutely cringe worthy.  There was no attempt to clean the room between customers and the employees seemed to take no pride in their work place.  There were photographers and hair and makeup people sitting around.  No one cleaned anything, except the hair and makeup people keeping their stations tidy (good job ladies!)  I'm willing to bet when it's quitting time, no one runs a vacuum or sweeps anything, it's lock up and run for the exit.\n\nThere was nowhere to store your things for outfit changes, so when you're going between each of the sections of the room (and they will make you move, taking pictures against every single background), you have to move your things (or store them in the hallway, risking theft.)\n\nThey made no attempt, when booking the appointment, to ask if a female or male photographer would be preferred, knowing it was for a boudoir session.  If a doctor's office can ask this question, surely it's easy for a photography studio to ask!  The female photographer there that day (only one), was alright, but she really isn't well versed at photographing girls that are not on the skinny supermodel side of the size spectrum in a flattering light.  The male photographer that I had was annoying.  He asked inappropriate questions (like asking if my friend wanted to have children), and attempted to get me into poses that were uncomfortable.  I had to draw the line at a pose that would have had my breasts falling completely out of my outfit, the angle and pose was so unnatural.\n\nThe poses are all manufactured and the same for everyone.  Some of them are awkward and unnatural, leaving the person looking uncomfortable and maybe a little scared they're going to fall.  No wonder a lot of the terrible Glamour Shots poses from the 90's had people looking absolutely terrified.\n\nThe makeup is not tailored to each person.  They used the same neutral palette on both of us, and it's a normal 4 shades of brown application that one would do for a smoky eye.  When asked what we wanted for hair, I'm not sure what my friend said, but I know I said I was looking for a pin up, vintage style.  It was a side part with curls.  That's it.  Everyone got a side part with curls, so I suppose everyone was going for a pin up, vintage style that wasn't actually pin up or vintage?\n\nThe $450 value assigned to the groupon was bullshit.  No one would pay $300 for that dvd slideshow.  It's set to crappy music, the Glamour Shots logo is all over the photos (distractingly so), and it includes their \""retouched photos\"" which look overly processed and filtered.  Seriously, learn photoshop people!  I'm 30, I don't need to look 12 with you erasing all of my laugh lines and smoothing out my skin so I look like a Botoxed Barbie.  I would have gladly traded the dvd slideshow for more prints, but that was not an option.\n\nI did not spend any extra money there because I was so disappointed in the entire experience.  The only reason that we'll be back is to pick up our pictures, but after that, not again.  We were there for nearly 7 hours, which is an obscene amount of time to spend in a place that isn't your job.",3
145,0,"First!! The food and drinks here are great. We used to come here every Sunday and eat dinner and hit a movie. Kudos to bartender Mitch for making memories with us. \n\nNow?? The remodel was highly anticipated and we traipsed through mall looking forward to seeing the brilliance. We immediately loved the blue tints and amazing fish tank, then on our way to the bar I tripped up the stairs. Clutzy me? Nope, there was some unfinished remodeling and something wasn't to code so well it wasn't just me but even after the manager apologized ever so kindly nothing was comped and I had a horrible bruise for more than three weeks -- I couldn't sit in chairs with arms or sleep on my right side.\n\nBut....we love Kona, so back we are today and it's crazy holiday madness and the stairs are fixed with a safer ramp thing, but....the bathroom seemed like 89 degrees hot and sopping wet and in disarray, the downstairs dining room was stuffy and smelly and bright as a cafeteria. And once safely upstairs the bartenders were flustered (but we do like Brett and have enjoyed his service a lot!!) and where oh where are the TVs? It is a tied game ...Cardinals are standing strong and I have to depend on the Yard House for yelling out updates. Not cool!!!\n\nGet it together Kona!

You would think that on the last Friday of the year, when Vegas is more crowded than usual, there would be more than one person working the counter. Well I thought wrong as I stood patiently in line in 46 degree weather. I could see one guy taking orders, working the cashier, AND preparing the food. After a 25 min wait I finally approached the window only to be told half the menu items were sold out! Really?! So I ordered the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate to see what all the hype was about. I am sad to say it was not worth the wait or $11! Very dissatisfied. The only positive is we didn't wait 45 min to be seated inside.",0
148,0,"Living up to try and be the next 'Ahhnold' (an Asian one anyway) or Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson (I am known in many circles as 'The Pebble'), I do enjoy my breakfast.  And I love, love, love eggs!  It's the world's most complete animal protein.  Bodybuilders and Meatheads alike know...if you want more muscle, you must eat more protein!  I'm far from my early 20's when I used to add a raw egg or 2 to my daily whey protein & creatine shake, or eat 6 hard boiled eggs daily to help 'bulk up'...but I still love me some eggs early in the morning!\n\nThe Cracked Egg if you can't already tell is a breakfast-heavy joint.  They are usually only open daily for breakfast and lunch.  It's been voted 'The Best of Las Vegas' by the LVRJ at least 3 times.  So I figure instead of making my own breakfast we'd go check this place out.  \n\nThe day we went it was packed!  Of course, it was a Sunday and church was probably just letting out.  There's a big hustle and bustle here, no shortage of orders being called out, waitstaff running around with plates, and the smell of fresh coffee being brewed.  Man, do I love the first meal of the day!  Yes, I am a morning person.  Night owls beware!\n\nMenu is a good size and offers a ton of choices.  Now with The Cracked Egg being its namesake, please realize that most of their dishes require EGGS.  If you don't like eggs or egg products STEER CLEAR.  Should be obvious.  Go back to your overpriced lattes and friggin' scones.  Go dunk your donuts somewhere else.  Go back to your toaster to watch those tarts pop.  I feel sad for you folks.\n\nThe Cracked Egg has different parts to their menu.  There's \""Breanne's Basics\"" which  have your plain eggs & bacon, eggs & sausage, and similar type stuff here.  In \""Eggs With Attitude\"" these dishes are mostly various things scrambled with eggs, which they call a 'scramble'.  I much enjoy the Southwest Scramble which has 3 eggs scrambled with chorizo, green chiles, jalapenos, onion, jack & cheddar cheese, and a side of salsa.  \""The Benedicts\"" is self-explanatory, a list of all their different Eggs Benedict concoctions.  Me?  I like the good ol' regular Eggs Benedict standard, done right.  In the \""Fluffy & Folded\"" section you got your 3 egg omelettes, and my faves are The Denver with ham, bell peppers, onions, and cheese, or The Greek with spinach, tomatoes, and feta.  Yum!  \""Sin City Skillets\"" are for you wannabe cowboys who like your food coming in a cast-iron skillet, build your own or choose one off of their menu.  The last big breakfast section is \""From the Griddle\"" and includes their French toast choices as well as fresh pancakes.  From what I've tried and what I've heard...it's all pretty good stuff.  \n\nThe Cracked Egg also has non-breakfast stuff for you non-breakfast eaters too.  From sandwiches and salads, to burgers and homemade chili, it's all there.  But why come to a breakfast joint and not have breakfast?  It's like going to El Pollo Loco and asking for fish!  Try the breakfast.\n\nOnly gripe I have here is that the prices are a bit on the high side.  I could make some of these dishes at home easily for half the cost, and do just as good a job since I love making breakfast anyway.  Two folks eating breakfast with a cup of joe each will probably set you back $25+ after tax and tip depending on what you eat.  Worth it if you go every once in a while or on a special occasion.  Or if you're loaded like Steve Wynn.  Geez, that guy is rich.\n\nStop by The Cracked Egg, have a hearty breakfast, then bench press that little Fiat in the parking lot!",0

There is almost always a line, even in the winter but there is plenty of people watching to do to pass the time.  I do wish they were open a little earlier but when I first started going they weren't open 7 days a week like they are now so I will take what I can get.

We wanted beer but got there at 11:45, so the waitress took our order and by 12:01 we had our beers on the table.  She was also really friendly and gave me a round for free because it was my birthday.  \n\nI would love to come back sometime and experience it at night when I am sure it is way cooler, but then again I probably don't want to have to fight the huge crowds that come.

164,0,"3.5 stars- very nice coffee shop! This plaza has so much to offer, glad to see there's a good place for a caffeine fix that isn't a Starbucks.\n\nWent in and used $10 credit Yelp deal, was helped by lady owner who was super sweet and informative about what they offered- opted for their cold-brewed tea in hazelnut, an iced latte, and a lemon dome dessert.\n\nCold brewed coffee was amazing- they brew it for something insane, like 24 hours, and it's specially made to avoid using regular coffee plus ice, which changes the flavor of the coffee itself and is watered down as the ice melts. Owner is clearly very knowledgeable and it shows in quality of product they put out. Both drinks were tasty.\n\nLoved the d\u00e9cor and ambiance of the shop itself- especially the shelves of books to peruse. Signage indicated that books are used available for sale, pricing is found in inside cover. Unfortunately, the two books I was interested did not have pricing listed, indicating that they weren't for sale.\n\nWould come back for a caffiene fix in the area, love that they offer live jazz music certain days of the week. Very chill place to enjoy a cup and some conversation.",2
165,0,"Sorry - an employee can definitely ruin it for me! I used to take my girls into the Sweet Factory at Galleria Mall about once a month. They each have a fave candy so I let them get 1/4 pound each and it lasts them for days. \n\nNORMALLY, the employees are VERY sweet and helpful. They smile, converse, offer samples, recommend items, etc.\n\nLast Saturday, my girls begged to go to the mall just to visit the Sweet Factory. I agreed, as it had been a long time since they had eaten candy.\n\nWe walked inside and were IGNORED by the new, young girl at the register. My youngest (age 5) even ran up to her and said, \""Hi! We are going to buy candy today\""! \nShe STARED at my child and ignored her. I became irritated but I let it go. \n\nWe grabbed our candy and went to the register to pay. She seemed irritated that we were in the store. (We did NOTHING wrong, we were quiet and quick).\n\nAs we were at the register, I noticed a more regular employee, an older woman (older than the girl at the register) and the girl suddenly perked up and GREETED the next customers who came in. \n\nIt became GLARINGLY OBVIOUS that the young employee was only being \""nice\"" when her boss was around. The older woman went into the back and we continued to pay. She proceeded to say NOTHING to us, not even \""thank you\"" when she handed over the bag.\n\nThe only time she seemed alert was when the other woman was around.\n\nAs we excited the store, I was MAD. She was rude, pure and simple. I made a comment to my husband her rudeness. \n\nAt the same time, another customer (a man and his young son) approached us. He was behind us in line. He asked, \""Was she as rude to you as she was to us?\""\n\nI wanted to call the store and complain about her but I felt like giving her the benefit of the doubt.

168,0,"I'm giving this place one star and that's only because of the location.  The restaurant is situated in the Old Port of Montreal, on a beautiful cobblestone street, tons of charm...that's where the positive part of this review ends.\n\nWe were greeted as we entered the restaurant and were seated quickly.  However, it took almost 20 minutes to get a glass of water, another 25 minutes to get our beer, which we ordered once our water was delivered.  When our extremely stressed, profusely sweating and almost invisible waiter did finally bring us our beer, in bottles, he asked us if we wanted a glass and if we did that we could go ahead and use our wine glasses, which we weren't using.\n\nAbout an hour after being seated, and 40 minutes after ordering our food, we still did not receive a morsel of food.  We noticed that the waiter had been bringing baskets of warm bread to the tables earlier, so I asked if it would be possible to get some bread while we waited for our food.  The waiter explained that 1) they were out of bread and were waiting for more to be delivered and 2) that even if they had bread that the oven was being used for something else and our bread would be cold.  He explained that we were \""first\"" on his list for bread once they got more bread.  About 20 minutes later, he brought us bread...it was cold, along with the butter.  My friend decided to heat the butter by holding it over the candle flame, which could have worked brilliantly, only the plastic packaging began to melt, so cold butter is what we settled for.  \n\nSalad was included with my meal, but not my friend's, so he ordered a salad in addition to his meal.  The salads arrived about an hour after we placed our order (yes, AN HOUR FOR SALAD).  \n\nWe did finally receive our food, I had ordered the salmon with shrimp sauce and my friend had ordered the whitefish.  The portion sizes were large enough, but my salmon was extremely fatty and the shrimp had not been deveined, and my friend's fish was riddled with bones, we counted at least 30 of them.   Both dishes were served with rice and overcooked vegetables (rappini and zuchini).  We asked our waiter to bring us some lemon wedges, but he forgot, so we asked the hostess and she went to the bar and got us some (of course this was almost 15 minutes after we had been served the fish).\n\nThe waiter did not once ask us how our meals were, nor did he ask us if we wanted another drink after we finished our beer.  We had to flag down the hostess for everything.  \n\nI'd like to point out that the restaurant was by no means busy, and we were not alone in our assessment.  We watched a table of 7 people gulp down their green soup, and then wait for well over an hour before receiving their mains, and only half the table got their mains, the rest had to wait an additional 10 minutes.  \n\nOur meals (salad and fish) along with 3 beers total over $85.  I have to say that paying that bill felt like wallet rape.\n\nAll in all, this place was a disaster and I would not return, and I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",0

170,0,"I went here excited by the prospect of mixing alcohol and ice cream, the perfect combo!  We braved the downtown Scottsdale crowds and lack of parking on a Saturday night just so we could try the ice cream here.  I asked the attendant which rum based ice cream he'd recommend, which was the strawberry amaretto rum.  It sounded delicious, so I decided to go with the recommendation and get a scoop to go.  Eating it in the car on the way back home, the more I ate, the more the ice cream tasted like cherry.  On second thought, I didn't taste any amaretto or rum in the ice cream either.  I couldn't taste any alcohol in the ice cream.  Then, I came to the realization that I was given a scoop of what tasted like cherry cheesecake ice cream, non-alcoholic, not strawberry amaretto rum, even though it was labeled as such.  Disappointed, it tasted OK, but I'm not a fan of cherry cheesecake in general, and I was wanting a signature alcoholic ice cream dessert.  So due to mislabeling, I'm going to have to dock a lot of stars.",0

With that said..\nthe chips were greasy and salsa tasted like Pace picante. \n\nI had the two taco plate of grilled chicken and steak tacos with re-fried beans and rice. The grilled steak taco had good flavor, but the chicken was VERY dry. I added lime and salsa to try and moisten it up.

173,0,"House of Window Coverings has the most unprofessional and unhelpful employees ever. I wanted to redo all of the windows in my house and their designer Jan came to help me decide what to get.\n\nJan was rude, condescending and just snarky. I had to chase her back to her car, because I wasn't done. I really wanted the window coverings or would have given up. I decided to get shutters for the whole house, placed the order and put down the deposit.\n\nSeveral days later the installers called to schedule the measuring. I was driving so asked if they could call back in an hour or two when I was home. \n\nAfter we hung up I got another phone call, and when I answered it turned out one of the installers had butt-dialed me back by accident and I could hear them talking about me. Jan had told them seriously horrible things about me (we were together for like one hour with my then 18-month-old son at home) and I could hear them discussing it. Seriously? What could have happened in an hour with a lone woman and a young toddler? Jan was obviously uninterested in me as a customer, judgemental and the worse salesperson ever. The installers were saying how mean I was and I was mad because they called while I was driving. Really? What I said almost word for word was, \""I'm driving now and can't access my calendar which is on my computer at home. Can you call me back in an hour or two?\"".\n\nI was so mad I called the owner and cancelled my order and got my $3000 deposit back. Luckily I had paid by credit card so they had no choice but to give me my money back. \n\nFast forward to now, three years later. As of 1 month ago I still hadn't gotten the shutters I wanted because I was so irritated by the previous experience. But a month ago I finally bit the bullet and called Sunburst. What a refreshing change. The guys they sent out were nice and helpful. If they had any negative thoughts about me and my family they kept it professionally to themselves.  My beautiful new shutters, complete with lifetime guarantee, were installed by two very nice and professional guys and look wonderful.\n\nI probably should be grateful about the bad experience I had BEFORE the shutters were really ordered. Any company with such unprofessional people can be counted on to do an unprofessional job. I see the location I initially ordered my shutters from, on Horizon Ridge in Henderson, has since closed. I'm not surprised that such a crappy company couldn't sell enough to pay the rent there.",0
174,0,"I went with a friend who wanted to try Japanese cuisine.  After having travelled extensively in Japan and been to Japanese restaurants in many countries I have been to and my verdict on this one was as follows:\n\nStarted off with sushi Chef's Choice - it was ok nothing to shout about but surprised we had to pay extra for ginger with the sashimi - never seen this before.\n\nMy friend had a bento box with Pork Teriyaki which was ok, pork was nice as was the Miso soup.\n\nTo my great misfortune I had the Ramen which lack any form of flavour, noodles were not fresh over cooked, the broth was not very hot and toppings where served cold which meant that the broth got even colder.  Seaweed was too sweet lacking any flavour and bamboo shoots tasted like ones out of a tin.  The egg yolk was detached from the white which was weird as it was all googy rather than runny. Told the waitress that the broth was cold and her reaction was the best by saying \""That Cannot be\"", took the soup away to be given the same one and told that's how we serve it and if they had to do another one it would be the same given toppings are cold. Overall very disappointing.\n\nWill definitely not go again for their Ramen but might pop over again to try another rice dish given the lack of Japanese Restaurants in Edinburgh.\n\nChoice of Sake was very poor.",0

176,0,"This review is only for the club.\nThis new club has quite the line up of DJ's, and the weekend we were there Tiesto was spinning on Sat night! Being that he is among the top DJ's on the planet, we figured it would be packed so, of course, I turn to my fellow Yelpsters for advice...\nLet me confirm and clear up a few things now that I have been there. \nFirst the nerve-wrecking stairs, this is a 5 story spot, but the club is only 3 stories. You enter on the main floor, so if you are there for EDM, stay there and no stairs. The main floor is the middle, so if you are there for hip-hop go downstairs, and now I can see a problem.\nSecond the non-VIP seating policy, there actually are places to sit for non-VIP. If you go downstairs, damn stairs!, you have two directions at the bottom, straight in the main room or do a 180 and walk down the hall. The back room is open seating, at least until the promoters sell the seat as VIP, but to us it seamed like we had a place to sit all night. Plus those bartenders are way less busy and hoooook it up!\nThird the nice staff, this one is true! These were without a doubt the nicest bouncers and bartenders we had ever dealt with, and we have been to clubs from SF to Ibiza. It was a much better feel than the normal steroid-staredown that you get from most clubs in Vegas. \nFourth the dress code, this is normal for Vegas, smart casual. A previous post mentions flip-flops, I did not see any, but let's face it a dress code is 99.9% for the guys so maybe she did sneak in with them on...\nFifth the music in the hip hop room, the posts about the gangster rap are probably from people that did not stay down there long enough, we really felt there was a good mix of many genres of hip hop, but we were there for Tiesto!\nLast the dance floor, prior posts are accurate, there is little to no dance floor for a club that holds 5000 people. The main dance floors get so packed that it becomes more of a collective fist pump rather than dancing. We found that upstairs was the better place to dance. There is an open area up there, and while not technically a dance floor, we sure turned it into one! Oh and you can see the DJ booth from up there, if you look through the VIP's lining the rail. \nThe lack of dance floor space is the reason I knocked a star off. All in all this is a great club, and with DJ's like Tiesto how can you go wrong.",0

If I were the one in the pictures I would have had to get a refund because my make up was melting right off my face just sitting there. Lol. They could have repaired that air-conditioner along time ago and given their customers a more pleasant experience but for some reason they hadn't. They didn't even warn me ahead of time the condition of the studio. It would have been nice to know that it would be such an uncomfortable temperature and possibly taken our business elsewhere. \n\nAlso, their props need to be updated because some are old and worn.

Even though I left details about what we were there for. \n\nOnce we were done taking pictures we needed to view and choose the poses we wanted printed. The girl that was helping us was unprofessional and rude. She answered a personal call in the middle of helping us. She also interrupted me mid sentence to gossip with another employee as if my children and I weren't standing right next to her.

185,0,So nice to see the new I-Hop location at Cotswald and I had the opportunity to visit last weekend with two other adults a newborn and 6 year old.  The waitress was super sweet.  Our order and meal went well and the food was tastey.  However I waited forever for my check.  I asked another server to let my waitress know I needed my check  but saw she had been seated a second table.  So I waited.  Then I got up and went to the kitchen door.  The other waiter came thru and said do you want to start tomorrow jokingly :) and then said she didn't come over yet??? and I said no.  So I go back to my table.  I then see the waitress at the computer assuming maybe she is preparing my check.  Wait. wait. wait.  Others at the table are getting annoyed too.  So I take my two pancakes on a plate up to the waitress.  I said I would like a box and my check please.  She is lost in a fog.  I said please get me a box and my check.  Again lost in fog.  I hand the plate to her and said I will meet you up front at the register.  I tipped her too and I really don't know why.  Should it take 2 hours to eat in an empty restuarant?

I told the PA Joseph that this was not normal as I am his mother and know how he is on a day to day basis.

Then he persists on trying to look in my sons mouth, keep in mind he is 16 months old. That is not an easy task but he has me lay him down to then harm him by forcing a stick in his mouth. At this point I am beyond upset with this PA. He then tells me well their is nothing we can do for him. As a wife to a fireman I naturally call my husband because this wasn't right. I asked for zofran to help with the nausea and vomitting, the PA wouldn't give me anything. He said we will call this fever with nausea, and for me to go to the ER on new years eve if it gets worse.

195,0,"I think this was probably the longest 65 minutes I've spent any any show.  Bite has moved to the Plaza and I had a free ticket last night so why not?  Well the long 65 minutes would be why not.\n\nThe show has been around for many years at the Stratosphere before moving to the Plaza so it's not jumping on the vampire movie craze that seems to have gripped the younger people.  \n\nI think the biggest problem is there really is no cohesive story and the show's writers don't know what kind of show they want other than topless (sometimes) female vampires doing different dances in different costumes in different amounts of dress/undress.  There are a couple of small magic tricks done by one of the male vampires and there were some strong man lifts and balances \u00e0 la Myst\u00e8re and the guys were OK.  But these disjointed segments of magic, dancing, strong man routines point out the unfocused nature of the show.  The showroom at the Plaza, which I think is a great classing Las Vegas room, is not designed for the types of things they used to do at the Strat.  There used to be some acrobatics done with silks, but that has to be dropped in this showroom.\n\nThe music was something else.  There was some 80s rock music and mixed in were two selections from opera that had almost no reason for being where they were.  Most of the music is recorded, but some was live and the singer was not too bad.\n\nAn acquaintance was seated at the same table as I was and his reaction was much the same as mine.

205,0,"Totally Ruined Evening.    \n\nIncompetent to Rude Hosts (I think one is the Owner) After arriving on a Monday Night at 7PM as a group of 5 without Reservations and a Huge Wedding Party we thought the place would be Too Busy, however we were told it would be 5 to 20 minutes for a Table and so we waited in the entrance area with group that Did have Reservations at 7:00 PM.\n\nWe Both were seated around 8:30 pm, no Apologies - Just Arrogance. It was a Table for four with a chair crowded onto the end in the walkway. Two of us ordered the same item and 20 minutes After ordering we were told there was only One Available. \n\nSo even though it was my wife's Birthday Dinner, she gave it up and ordered a Simple House Salad instead, while I just Ordered Soup out of frustration. The other three in the Party got the dishes they wanted and the food finally arrived at 9:30PM - two and a half Hours after we first entered the place.  Even their Garlic Rolls were not refilled after initially bringing a small bowl for five people - I guess they were hoping they could sell appetizers.\n\nI have many times taken out of town guest there, always Arrogance and Drama and some waiting, Yet Never again. Even my out of town guest stated after we left and all we had been through they would never recommend this Restaurant to anyone and tell them to be sure to avoid it. \n\nThey have enough business and they don't care - so why should We. \nIf you go for the Food, it's above average, however be prepared for Arrogance and Long waits with a (Owner) Host that always makes the place Frantic.",0
206,0,"The one thing that I can't tolerate about restaurants that charge more than $40 per entree is BAD SERVICE.\n\nWe waited an hour before our server, let's call her \""B\"", came back so that we could order drinks.  She never came back to ask us how our entrees were.  And we never received any of the complimentary sweets that everyone on Yelp has raved about.  All of this would have been fine except that we left her a \""mandatory\"" $80+ tip. I think that the bad service on our server's part can be partially attributed to automatic tip and partially because we came towards the end of the night.  \n\nRealizing that servers and busboys make most of their livelihood from tips, we decided pay the 20% tip and not punish the busboys, who were very prompt and polite, never letting our water glasses go below half empty.  I did go talk to the manager to let him know that the service at his restaurant was less than perfect.   When I did, he shrugged and said, \""Thanks for telling us.\""  He didn't offer us any kind of compensation OR even note which table we were sitting at and who our server was.  With management like that, it is no wonder that the so many people have criticized the service as lackluster.\n\nThe food was pretty good--the pappardelle bolognese was delicious, but the pasta was a little too al dente, and the veal chop was juicy, flavorful, and all-around amazing.  The gnocchi tasted like an overly firm polenta.  \n\nOverall, I think the food is pretty good, but I would tell people not to go to B&B because of the bad service.",0

208,0,"I chose the 4 Queens for my visit to Las Vegas for several reasons, and I'll admit a good lot of those involved the low price of the room. (Other reasons include the proximity to the Neon Boneyard, the historic old-Vegas reputation of the hotel and the ratings on Trip Advisor.)\n\nHowever, the quality of my room was far below what I expected, or even dreamed was possible.\n\nI have very minimal requirements for hotel rooms; generally I only want them to be clean (not spotless, clean) and relatively safe. Non-smoking is also on the list.\n\nMy room at the 4 Queens was the filthiest hotel room I've ever stayed in.\n\nThere was hair (of the nether-region variety) in the bathtub. In fact, I don't think the shower or bathtub were touched by house cleaning before or during my stay. I don't like to make a fuss so wiped-everything down myself, and was too exhausted to switch rooms on top of that.\n\nEvery surface in the room felt greasy. I'm going to say it was covered in some Pledge-like substance (humor me) to make myself feel better.\n\nThere was an empty packet of Lucky Strike cigarettes behind the one side of the drapes and a lighter on the other when I arrived, and spotted quite easily. This was touted to be a non-smoking room. I left the empty cigarette pack and lighter for the duration of my stay to see of it would be eventually picked-up by the housekeeping staff. \n\nNope; no such luck.\n\nAdditionally, there were cigarette burns in the bedding (which was made of some, scratchy, ugly cheap fabric). Two of the three lamps in the room did not work. At all. The remote did not work. The air conditioner was very, very loud.\n\nI didn't realized that the Academy of Country Music awards we're being held in the city the weekend I stayed, and on the 15th floor, I could hear the awful cover bands from Fremont Street quite clearly. Granted, I should have realized the ACMs were the weekend of my stay, but the noise was a bit ridiculous.\nOh, and the folks staying in the room next door smoked weed every night of my stay. I dare say I could very well have gotten a contact-high the smell was so strong.\n\nLuckily, I take Ambien to sleep, and am dead to the world at night. Even with the Ambien, the world's rattliest, loudest air conditioner, still woke me up several times each night. This is in addition to being woken by the amazingly loud sex the reefer users next door were having. Otherwise there is absolutely no way I would have gotten any rest in this hellhole.\n\nUpdate! I initially wrote this review with one night of my stay remaining. Guess what? It got worse! The country band playing on the street on Saturday night was somehow (defying the laws of sound) louder, and played later into the evening. Once my Reefer Madness neighbors returned to their room at near 4am, they rented several porn movies and acted out scenes from them. This went on until about 8 am. I pounded on the wall twice, called the front desk, and nothing was done! I didn't sleep a wink despite the Ambien.\n\nI finally headed to the airport around 9 am, five hours early for my flight, because the hotel was just that damn bad, and I couldn't stand the filthiness and sleaze any longer.\n\nAbsolutely the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. The only thing that could have made it worse are bed bugs or a fire possibly breaking-out.",0

Not even barely.....dominated.  The atmosphere is really cool, good beers on tap starting at $8, and the balcony could be sneaky chill when it gets warmer.  A lot of fun will be had at this venue.      \n\nI wasn't digging the seats for bowling.  It would have been awkward if our party of 4 all sat on the big leather couch together as it was a tight squeeze.  The party of 8 across our table were pretty bunched up.  It also would've been kind of a mess had they ordered drinks and food too since all 12 of us were sharing one (albeit long) table.  \n\nDefinitely dine before bowling because eating with your hands, playing with balls and then eating more is gross.  Someone is bound for pink eye or worse.  Although \""The Fatty\"" pizza was Stouffer's French bread pizza on steroids delicious, I had to eat it with a fork while standing.  That's kinda lame.  \n\nIt's all minor stuff in the whole picture of things.  Can't wait to check out some shows!  Lots of great acts on the schedule already.",0

I had my daughter at Top of the Classs for about a month and a half before pulling her out due to rude staff and the poor quality education she was receiving. I am absolutely shocked that this place is in business. I can concur with another Yelper about the front doors constantly being left open which is extremely concerning. On top of the lack of security, I'm not sure any of the teachers have any formal education or teaching credentials. Miss Melanie the supervisor/manager is extremely brusk and rude. If she was working the front desk she would NEVER greet my daughter or me at drop offs or pickups. She would make eye contact and look back down at her phone or paperwork. The center is outdated and I witnessed large groups of children eating snacks and lunches on the floor in the hallway. There were older children (8-10 year old's) running around the younger pre-k children completely unsupervised. My daughter learned some EXTREMELY inappropriate things and constantly complained about older kids picking  on her and calling her names. My daughter is well adjusted and has never had issues.

229,0,"Club Tempo has started a new weekly event called Jazzy Sundays. Doors open at 8pm where they have complimentary stepping classes. Afterward ,they have a live band. The format is creative and allows for a bit of variety. However, unfortunately, as is the case with a few minority owned establishments, things are not what they first appear to be.  \n\nThe first negative: They sell alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages but no food. In my opinion, an establishment catering themselves to adults over the age of 30 should be able to provide more than simply alcoholic beverages; from an entertainment and safety standpoint. Tempo does bring out a selection of 4 hot food choices around 9:30, which they liberally term a buffet. Perhaps this is their attempt to compensate for their lack of a kitchen.  The food does not stick around long and lasts for about 30 minutes before it is eaten depending on the number of attendees that evening. \n\n2nd, in order to use a credit card one has to spend over $20. They have an ATM machine you can use that will gladly charge you a service fee if you don't carry cash around like most business professionals. \n\n3rd, the most important criteria I have when patronizing an establishment is the quality of their customer service. This is where Tempo severely under-shines.  They underwhelm in making sure their guests are comfortable. The use of polite terms like excuse me, i apologize, sir or what have you appears to be a foreign concept.  Tempo caters toward bothers and sisters and are owned by brothers. You would think they would provide equivalent or better hospitality than their caucasion/white counterparts? This is not the case. Tempo is one of those establishments were they feel they are doing you a favor, when in realty they are providing a service. Bad news travels much further than good news and Tempo's ownership would be best served by taking heed of this.\n\nIn summary, there are much better and friendly establishments to frequent than tempo.",0

233,0,"I liked, but did not love, La Reve.\n\nAs others have mentioned though, that is probably because I had seen several Cirque shows before, both in Vegas and on tour.  \n\nLa Reve is pretty to look at and very well done... and there are elements that I truly enjoyed but it just didn't hold my attention the entire time like a Cirque show can. \n\nWhat I did like was the somewhat dark and mysterious nature of the show in spots.  The opening with the craggy, industrial looking tree and the acrobatics that take place on it, is fantastic to watch.  \n\nAlso the section with the angels (though some people have said \""doves\"" but my first thought was angels) reminded me of what I would think an angel would look like.  Not that I am particularly religious, I'm not... I just don't buy into sweet and gentle nature of angels that is so commonplace.  With that in mind, that particular part of the show was kind of like a Revelations type descent from heaven come to life, for me.  It was pretty breathtaking.  \n\nAside from that, because I am a dancer I love watching choreography of all forms and I love the demonstration of the human body and what it's capable of.  These performers are so strong, and so well rehearsed... it's really quite awesome.\n\nWould I go back and see it again?  No.   There really isn't a bad seat in the house, and it was worth my time..

Once there, are drink order was taken, appetizer were ordered, and then it was 15 minutes before the waitress came back take our order. When appetizer arrived one had to be sent back and took forever to get back. Then we waited for 30 minutes after the appetizers were killed before our food arrived.

237,0,"The Skinny: Nice hotel, great place to stay even though there isn't much to do other than go to the spa, stay by the pool, eat or gamble - but there's nothing wrong with that(4.5).\n\nWe stayed here for two weekday nights in August for a brief staycation. Check-in service was painless albeit it was a weekend day afternoon and not very busy.\n\nWe were really impressed by the ambience of the hotel room (resort room with a view of the Strip). The modern decor matched our tastes. There was a flat screen tv with a Bose wave sound clock radio.  The bed, covered with plush pillows and fresh linens, was comfortable. The bathroom was great - two vanity sinks with an integrated tv (which had bad reception), enclosed granite shower, a bathtub with a view of the Strip (and a electronic privacy shade if you desire). Complementary cards were included in the suite. Maid service was excellent.\n\nUse of the fitness area costs $15 and internet costs $13/day which seemed rather pricey to me. I'll post a pic of the spa prices (note: they charge you a mandatory 20% gratuity!).\n\nThe amenities include use of the pool area which was lovely. We enjoyed lazing around the pool all afternoon like two slugs. It was awesome! The crowd there is diverse - you see kids in their lifejackets, the elderly sunning next to their wheelchairs and the young 20 somethings sporting designer shades and swimwear. The music is top 20's with some pop favourites from the 80's. Fortunately, the music was at a comfortable decibel level.\n\nThe casino itself was quiet during our weekday vacay and was relatively smoke free for a casino. Also really like they didn't pump some yucky perfume in the ventilation system like other casinos on the Strip. Loved the free beverage fountain next to Marinelli's which wasn't watered down! (they had Fresca! I love Fresca!)\n\nDisadvantages: well, if you don't gamble, go to the spa, lounge in the pool or check out Tina Martini- there isn't much here to do unlike other local casinos which have movie theatres and bowling alleys. \n\nThe location is another factor to consider because there really isn't much around the casino - plus it's far from the Strip for visitors. You'll definitely need a car if you stay here.\n\nFinally, the food doesn't quite live up to level of quality at the hotel. Compared to other Strip casino hotels which have great restaurants there or nearby, this hotel's food is okay but not great.\n\nOverall, a really nice stay and we were glad we came to relax here.

We said that our waitress had done a great job of that. The manager than rudely ran over yelling that the waitress could be fired for that and we should never ask again. I did not realize what a crime it was to ask them to go light on the veggies. Then when we were paying the bill (the manager is also the cashier) he told me that this was the owners wishes.

243,0,"We r from chicago and came to khyber halal after reading positive reviews on yelp. The restaurant is charming, quaint, and well - decorated with authentic afghani decor and pieces, also very clean. The owner/head chef Fahima greeted us and was our server. She was incredibly pleasant and gave us great recommendations. She discussed that she tries to use organic ingredients and tries to make dishes healthy for her customers. All of her meat entrees are halal.\n\nOur first visit we had beef samosa and shami kabob for appetizers. Each came with fresh green chutney and tasted as if she had just freshly hand made the dough, meat, and chutney. We ate afghani dishes including kabli pulao and uzbek pulao, both spectacular. The helpings of rice are heaping, and you'll definitely have leftovers. Thr prices are very reasonable.\n\nSince our visit, my family reminisced about the delicious taste of her food every meal in phoenix, nothing compared. We came back and tried her pakistani dishes, equally delicious! Her naan is so plump and tastes made in a tandoor.  This place is always crowded and filled with a diverse crowd.  Mango lassi is perfect after a morning hike. Dessert including phirni and baklawa taste homemade.\n\nWe will probably b back again during our vacation, but wanted to post this since I am truly in love with this place. The owner Fahima is incredibly talented and will probably b known as a great chef in the near future.  \n\nIf you are in phoenix, definitely visit this place, your taste buds will not forget it!",4

249,0,"Lets just say i am a very easy going & understanding person & it takes a lot to annoy me. Probably one of the worst experiences I have had at a place like this. I was visiting AZ last weekend, friends suggested I go here since its a new place in old town. Got there around 8.30 and after 25 mins of looking for table we found one. It took another 20 for someone to take our order (we ordered food & drinks). As we waited for our food  the rude bouncers came and asked us to get up and move to the next table, we did, then a few minutes later, they told us they needed the chairs we were sitting on, and they took those as well. At this point our table had been pushed completely In front of a hugeee fan, & we had no chairs. While standing around like fools & telling the bouncer had food coming,the bouncer said he would get us chairs & turn the fan off- it never happened. The next part is what ticked me off- the server brought our food and placed it right in front of the fan, allowing dirt & dust\nTo be blown on it, not to mention the cheese on my pizza coagulated within seconds. 10 mins after the food was just laying around . At this point I refused to eat the food & continued to finish my drink & asked for the bill to pay for my drinks. This is quite funny, I get the bill and they had charged me for my the food as well. Not one apology, not one 'let me see if I can find a table'. The server was nice enough to bring us 2 free beers which I didn't even touch because I was soo annoyed. But overall it was an unpleasant experience.",0
250,0,"Ok I LOVE rounders, do not get me wrong. I have been coming to the blue diamond location for about three years and have never had but amazing service. Well today I went for an early morning drink. And as usual I play music via their touch tunes. I always play a good mix rap, rock, country and of course some good ole Mexican music ie Selena and Elvis Crespo. Nothing crazy like I said a good mix of music and no one has ever complained. Well today I played a nice popular Selena song and about halfway in the owner Ed walks over to me (obviously the only Hispanic customer there) and asks me if I had picked this song. Awkward I go well yes I did why is there a problem. Ed tells me well I just wanted to make sure someone paid for this and it is not a random song, usually we skip music like this. As my jaw drops I ask why. Well Mr. Donald Sterling tells me well it's early in the morning and I don't want people to get uncomfortable  it's almost like playing hardcore rap music with a bunch of F bombs no one wants to hear that. Whoa whoa whoa it's an open juke box and if you don't want certain types of music played then block it. Simple as that. So I tell him to give me my money back and he can skip the song. Ed tells me no that's ok he will let me play my song this time. And I could already see who had complained as an older woman and her maybe mother or friend had a sour look on their face as they were staring at me. Well my response to all of that was hello you are at a bar before noon and there are no listed guidelines on what music to play. So I will take my money somewhere else where my brownness will not offend anyone. Sorry Ed you lost a really loyal customer over two older women and their fear of a little diversity.",0

I have spent more time problem-solving the product than using it.  \n  \nEach time I worked with my local B&N store and B&N telephone technical support staff to resolve the numerous problems I had encountered with the NookColor.  I have become more and more frustrated with each encounter.  The first Nook I bought was on December 15 onlne and received around December 22.  I returned it because it had a line across the screen.  I received my second Nook one month later than promised, around mid February 2011.  This Nook had \""synchronization\"" problems:  letters repeated when the virtual keypad was used and pages scrolled when certain areas of the pad were touched.  I received my third Nook mid-March 2011.  This third Nook scrolled many pages (50 or so at a time) without my touching the screen and it eventually froze.\n  \nI am finally at my wit's end.  I am afraid that the next product that \nwill be sent to me will also have defects.

Being big MJ fans, we were looking forward to the music and some MJ style group dancing .... the music was overshadowed by the production's \""extra\"" noise which was never part of his original recordings and we felt the dance routines were not reflective of any rountines MJ did.  The \""story\"" if you can call it that, made no sense and having the child-like players running on and off the stage and the woman pretending to play the guitar were distractions at best.

260,0,"I really wish Yelp would allow zero stars.\n\n\nSince Airpark Dodge is local We figured it would be a great place to go purchase our exact specification of a Jeep Grand Cherokee for exactly the cost we investigated as fair.\n\nWe attempted to make this purchase at Airpark Dodge using our own funding.  This process will include working out the deal over the phone....The below story can be summed up with Airpark's final statement to me as \""...if you do not finance through us we don't want your business and we want you to leave\""\n\nIn any case,  Airpark Dodge made this the most adversarial car purchasing experience I have ever had.  They are, in my opinion, the most extremely aggressive, misleading, non-scrupulous and untrustworthy dealership I have ever run across.  They wasted a full day of my time and I suggest, prior to going, you tread lightly and consider about anyplace else.\n\n***********************\nDuring the entire 24 hour process (to the hour) we were extremely clear we had our own financing with an extremely good rate (one they would either not beat or could barely match). In any case we clearly stated we are simply there to purchase the vehicle only and for the amount we required.  It was very clear nothing less than these statements would be acceptable and we wanted a quick and easy transaction.\n\nWe started the day with the requirements stated and accepted over the phone.  All we needed was the purchase agreement from them. And we would be on our way to the bank to pick up the check and make our purchase.\n\nWithout going into the line by line issues I will simply state a full day of \""misunderstandings\"" on totals, rebates, sums, flaws and missteps occurred.  They continuously sent incorrect data to give to the bank.  Not only incorrect data but incorrect paperwork.  It was extremely clear as to what we were looking for.  I find it very hard to believe they have never dealt with a customer in this manner.\n\nIt became obvious I would have to go and get it from them physically (which ends out being exactly what they wanted). Upon arrival the salesman attempted to have me sign all their standard applications for credit (of which I, again, clearly stated I wanted no part of).  In fact at one point he attempted to convince me it was for the purchase only that he required this information (this included my ssn).... I may be dense but not that dense and I clarified my position by statingif I gave you my ssn you do not have permission to run my credit.... Funny, he no longer cared to get that filled out and ran off to see his manager (and I had no intention of giving this to him anyhow)\n\nThe finance manager got into the mix, actually had the nerve to ask me to explain what the problem was.  After spending the last day working on this I was not about to describe the events of the day.  This particular question was a bit misleading as shortly after he talked as though he was fully versed in the situation.  I am pretty sure he was not fully versed in my particular situation, I sincerely believe he was versed in the script written for our particular purchasing requirement.\n\nWell as we know they said they don't want our business if we are not going to finance through them.  They also mentioned we will receive a negative review anyhow.... Guess they didn't think of yelp.\n\nI know I should have left sooner but was stuck on the good price I worked out......Really should have left sooner.\n\n.... And the rest of the story....\nThe next day we went to Chapman Dodge....the acquired the exact same (physically the same) vehicle and sold it to us for exactly our asking price.  The purchase experience was exactly what I hoped for, very smooth, no pressure, no worries.  I was very clear on what we wanted and the abided by our decisions and processed the paperwork for which we required.  \n\nI highly recommend you consider going to Chapman Dodge as you first attempt to purchase your vehicle.",0
261,0,I enjoy the patio dining here. The mountain view is beautiful when the sun is going down which is about the time happy hour is winding down as well. The same waiter (I didn't get his name) has served my table several times and he is topnotch. It's a good place to have a drink and relax.\n\nI like the green rice and boiled whole pinto beans. It's a lighter option to the standard sides of beans and rice offered at most Mexican restaurants. I don't usually order appetizers here. The entree portions are large and they bring out some really yummy chips and salsa to start making the apps unnecessary. The fajitas are large enough to share or take home and reheat for lunch the next day. They offer a nice selection of Mexican beers on tap. Which I like because I prefer draft to bottled brew.,3

264,0,"Yoli's has recently been popping up on Yelp's 'Best Of' front page. Many people are mouthing out and as the food whore that I am, I needed to go out and try it for myself.\n\nMy previous research told me that there were many 5 stars and 3 stars reviews regarding the ambiance, service and food. It seemed that the place had be 5-stars for a while but trending analysis showed a decline in the late 2011- early 2012. Alright enough nerd talk-  it was a Saturday morning, I was starving and I needed a place to have brunch with my lady friend in town.\n\nWhen it comes to brunch at Yoli's, you really need to leave all your expectations at the door. The neighborhood its in is a little sub-par, the parking situation isn't grand and the interior and patio decor resembles a home that stopped paying for landscaping services a long time ago. The tables outside are all basic basic plastic, they are not squeaky clean (or perfectly leveled) and the seating is pretty limited. If you are coming to Yoli's, you are coming here for the food and nothing else, this ain't no brunch at the Four Seasons.\n\nTheir menus are strictly breakfast/brunch related but at a 2-sided page list, their breakfast choices do have a large variety of flavors and prices. The food is on the stealthier side with skillet dishes, omelets and diner-style potato sides. My friend and I ordered their most popular dish, the El Monte- Hawaiian french toast sandwich filled with egg whites, turkey, bacon and cheese with a 'spicy orange marmalade'. At about $7, the sandwich was pretty large and filled me up easily after just half of it. The french toast itself was soft and spongy and the bacon had some crisp, but the turkey was very thinly-sliced deli meat so it didn't have a lot of flavor and the spicy marmalade was tasty but not spicy at all.\n\nThe service was a tad slow but the lady was very very courteous and nice to us, she just didn't stop by very often so we had to wait around for our drinks and our check for quite a while. Overall I wasn't blown away with Yoli's but I would recommend as a place with decent portions and good prices. As of now, a 3.75 stars on my book.\n\nI am a big supporter of local restaurants and I love seeing a family-owned business thrive. With a little bit more decor, faster service and a cleaner environment this place can return to be the GEM that people used to talk about. Yoli, if you are reading this- I hope you take this advice, we all want to see you succeed so we hope you can get back on that horse and impress the hell out of us. Good Luck!!",4
266,0,"We stayed at the Silverton Casino 5-17 to 5-19-13. What a gem! He had just stayed 5 nights in the Penthouse Suite at The Mirage, so while the room was quite different than we were used to, it was very clean, comfortable, and quite large for a typical hotel room. We paid $59/night for a Fri-Sat stay, which is far less than you could get for a similar room on the Strip. \n\nThe room was very nicely decorated in Earth tones. Our room had a very comfortable king sized bed, two night stands, a love seat in a small sitting area, dining table, and a television armoire. They haven't yet upgraded to flat screen televisions in the Deluxe King rooms, but we didn't spend any time in the room watching television anyway. There is a safe located inside the television armoire, which is very small, but suitable for cameras and small electronic equipment. \nAir conditioning worked very well, although the unit itself was somewhat noisy. This actually turned out to be a plus, as the night we arrived they were having a Zumba dance party by the pool, and listening to the air conditioner was more pleasant than the horrid music pumping out during the marathon exercise session\n. \nThe bathroom is small, but perfectly adequate. The biggest complaint was that the shower head was too low for my 6'3\"" sweetie. Otherwise, the bathroom was stocked with plenty of towels along with Bath and Body Works products. Hot water was plentiful and the water pressure was great.\n\nThe casino itself is awesome. Very large, plenty of slot machines and table games are available. The Silverton Rewards club provides great benefits, and we both received a pass to Seasons Buffet once we earned 50 points on the Rewards Card (which took all of about 20 minutes to earn). We are both non-smokers, and neither of us had any complaints about excessive smoke in the casino. In fact, the only time I ever noticed smoke was if a smoker sat down next to me. Wait staff in the casino was FAR superior to any of the casinos we played at on the Strip.\n\nThe restaurants at Silverton are fabulous. We ate at nearly every single restaurant on property and enjoyed them all. I wouldn't say that Seasons was the greatest buffet in the world, but it was clean, food was well stocked, and our waiter was right on top of everything. Mi Casa Cantina serves up excellent Mexican food at a very reasonable price. The Sundance Grill is open 24 hours and provides casual dining with late night food specials. We ate breakfast here; it was tasty and very budget friendly. Johnny Rockets is also located on the casino floor, but we did not eat here on this trip. The flagship of the Silverton dining experience is Twin Creeks- which is an absolute must-visit during your trip. It has a beautifully romantic ambiance, and serves upscale steakhouse fare at prices much lower than similar restaurants on the Strip. The Tomahawk Rib Eye was simply divine! I just can't say enough about this incredible restaurant and the amazing staff.\nThe Silverton is connected to a Bass Pro Shop. If you are into that kind of thing, this store is huge and gorgeous. We went in and walked around, but didn't buy anything. Neither one of us are into outdoor sports, so I can't comment on whether or not the place is overpriced.\n\nThe best thing about the Silverton is the overall atmosphere and service level. The staff members were all very accommodating, helpful, and extremely friendly. We didn't have a bad experience with a single staff member on property, and we went everywhere. Upon our arrival at around 11am, we had practically no wait for service, and the front desk clerk had no problem giving us an early check in time. All the housekeeping staff made sure to say hello anytime they walked by, and all of the wait staff members in the restaurants were attentive and friendly. The casino caters to a slightly older clientele with some locals, and since there isn't a nightclub on property, there is very little pretentiousness among the guests. Everyone we ran into was relaxed and polite. And then there is the convenience factor; everything at the hotel/casino is within a 5 minute walk from your room, and the hotel is all of 10 minutes away from the Strip. Free shuttle service runs from the hotel to the airport, and to Caesar's Palace on the Strip if you don't have a car. \n\nIf it sounds like I'm gushing upon the Silverton, it's because I am. This was my first trip to Vegas, and my first off-strip hotel. I must say I was highly impressed, and we will definitely be making return trips to this fabulous little hotel in the future.",3
267,0,"Was here for a convention.  The bathrooms in the convention area were spacious and clean.  However, the lunch breaks offered very little for the people with any dietary restrictions.  Even my local sandwich shop in Austin TX can make me a sandwich with gluten free bread.....not so much in Vegas.  I ate salads for lunch and eggs/bacon for supper mostly as I was too tired to find a good restaurant with a chef that can do gluten free/dairy free.  Thought the gambling area smelled like smoke, so I didn't do any gambling there.  Since my only other experiences in Vegas are either at the Bellagio or Mandalay Bay, the Mirage is average at best IMHO.\n\nUpdate later that same year:  Girls weekend in Vegas for 4 ppl.  Reservations made all together on one credit card and one name so they are linked together.  Requested adjoining/connecting rooms as this was a girls weekend.  When we arrived the reservations were NOT linked.  They did not have us in adjoining or connecting rooms.  They did NOT alter that fact, nor did they seem to care that this was inconvenient or a problem.  They did not address it or offer any compensation for this HUGE inconvenience.  It really affected the trip that if two of us went up and were not the two sharing the same room, then we either had to be apart or cart items between the rooms...same goes for sharing accessories, having morning coffee, etc.  It was just a drag.  The Mirage was seemingly unaware of how girls weekends operate.  Their attitude was uncaring and I will NEVER go back.  Why make a reservation for two rooms in advance if the reservation itself is not honored?  Why pay a reservation hold fee if it isn't holding what you want?  Why go out of town for a girls weekend, if you can't spend the weekend with the girls?  We did have fun, but the inconvenience was a bit dampening.  If you expect good customer service go to the Bellagio, if you want clean rooms and no service, then stay here.",0
268,0,"Pros:  Its cheap, and its the only pyramid shaped hotel in Vegas. The casino and other general areas of the hotel are well maintained, good location.\n\nCons:  Rooms are dated and not very clean including the bathroom, furniture falling apart, hole in the wall, flickering lights, shower turns off for no reason, toilets that don't flush.  The elevators in the pyramid are nauseating.\n\nAs I stated earlier, its cheap and you get what you pay for.  Not horrible, but I will not be back at least as an overnight guest.

269,0,"allow me to join the chorus of \""what happened to this place?\""s.  my first visit, about 15(!) years ago, was quickly followed by several more because the place was a lot of fun.  in the intervening time, yes, i've changed a bit - but Gameworks has changed more, and not in a good way.\n\nmost of the games here dispense tickets, quickly followed by a raft of mediocre racing simulators that are from a generation or two ago.  a lot of the semi-unique things i might've tried are \""under repair.\""  maybe most disappointingly, there are only four real vintage games - and their CRTs are in bad shape.\n\nGameworks is something i used to look forward to visiting when i was in this area, not so much because i think it's a great place but for the memories.  well, no use now - it's a shell of its former self.  best to leave what good memories remain untainted, stay that way.\n\n(note:  if you're taking little kids, it might be pretty good.  i wouldn't guess 5 stars for that even, though.)",0
270,0,"With great bagel sandwich names and wonderful combinations, Owen's Bagels is a solid locale to grab breakfast and/or lunch. The menu can be a bit overwhelming, so they have it narrowed down by the type of meat involved (which is helpful for folks who only eat certain meats). And if you go on the weekend, be prepared for a line and a bit of a wait due to the popularity of this trendy little joint. \n\nI've tried the following:\n\n1. The Muenster Mash on a whole wheat bagel - Hummus, Muenster, Green Peppers, Onion, Lettuce, and Tomato. Seriously good. My favorite bagel at Owen's. No need for meat when you have all this delicious veggieness on one homemade bagel. And at only $4.00, this is a steal.\n\n2. Sir Purr's Purrfect Bagel on whole wheat - Turkey, Veggie Cream Cheese, Smoked Cheddar, Lettuce, Tomato. I never thought I'd say this, but there was WAY too much cheese on this thing. Not sure if the maker of the sandwich was just heavy-handed with the veggie cream cheese or what, but I had to scrape a bunch of it off before I could even eat the sandwich. After that it was very good. A bit more expensive at $5.65.\n\n3. Cinnamon Raisin Bagel with Maple Nut Cream Cheese - I do not recommend this option. The bagel barely had any raisins in it and wasn't really very cinnamon-y, either. And the maple nut cream cheese was disgusting. Go for one of the sandwiches and you'll be much happier with your experience.\n\nBe sure to bring your appetite as the bagel sammies are quite large. And take some time to read all the funny little quips written on the walls - or write some for yourself - either way you'll be entertained. Owens is located in South End across from the Atherton Mills Market. So swing in for a bagel sammie and then run across the street for some healthy fruits and veggies. A win-win all around!",3

272,0,"No...no....no!!!\n\nThe atmosphere is a very forced slightly more upmarket Spannish in a bottle you see in la Tasca and the food is much the same equation.\n\nLooking at the service they are actually very good, prompt and non-intrusive they did a fine job all evening.\n\nThe food for me though was a real let down, I tried the following:\n\nClassic Calamari: now I am a man that loves his squid but as soon as I saw the very pale looking batter you could see it was soggy and I was unhappy, the squid itsself was cooked fine but clearly their oil temperatures are too low creating the soggy mess I had on my plater. Judgement: 1 star\n\nChorizo & Black Pudding: cheap chorizo maketh the good meal not. An almost illumonous colour this stuff had no real defined flavours and was very chewy - the black pudding was of a decent quality but was over cooked and suffered from the over powering chorizo infused tomoato sauce. Judgement 1 star.\n\nPaela Valenciana: 1 prawn - overcooked, 3 pieces of chiecken - overcooked, 2 pieces of pork - overcooked. Now the flavours of this were good but as they clearly microwave the portions for serving the meat goes as tough as old boots. Judgement 1 star.\n\nChicken gougons with honey and mustard: nice bit pieces of chicken ina   light crispy batter was very nice. Def the high point of the evening. Judgement: 4 stars.\n\n\nScallops with crispy serrono : lovely crispy serrono - but with scallops do them fresh or not at all. These were frozen efforts that had been undercooked to make then seem soft. Horrid!! Judgement 1 star!!\n\nThe other saving grace of the evening was the drinks, 1 pitcher of sangria helped to wash my mouth out and the braqndy coffee was as good as ive had.\n\nAll in all not a good experience, I have heard this is a poor recreation of their Glasgow restaurant. My tip to them would be either improve or LEAVE!!!\n\nJd = not happy man!",0

I joined some old friends for dinner at Don and Charlies at the recommendation of my friend's family. To be fair I am a \""foodie\"",so this might seem a little harsh.  . The first thing I received when I walked into the place was the smell of mold mixed with some industrial cleaner,probably the most pleasant  aroma that I had throughout the evening and of course the duct tape all over the old carpet was quite attractive..My server  informed us that she had worked there for 30 years..Wow. Unfortunately for her time here she couldn't answer  our questions very well. We asked about the  so-called Prime beef ,if that actually meant Prime Grade  Beef  she seemed dumbfounded and if it was wet or dry aged.Also inquired what was in the rice pilaf ( vegies,stock etc) still no definitive answer,what size were the shrimp . We were not trying to harass the server we  have some  dietary needs and we were trying to  get some entrees and appetizers  that we could all share.We decide on  the chopped liver,the rib appetizer and a couple of wedge salads,caesar,and a french onion soup to begin followed by salmon,New York ,prime Rib,BBq cicken,Bone in Rib eye and ,halibut. The ribs were not very meaty and extremely tough  probably the worst that I have ever had,,french onion tasted like knorr beef stock and liver..and we all love pate, was quite frankly disgusting. The steaks were ok but not prime grade the salmon was previously frozen  farm raised Atlantic salmon the deli cole slaw was decent the creamy tasted ok but exactly like the Colonel's The BBq chicken was gross.,Halibut was so-so. All and all  my review of the place would be outdated cuisine prepared without skill or love but with the same price points as high end steakhouses in the area. The place just looks old and tacky with ripped chairs, old smelly carpet,.crud stuck beneath the tables and servers who  are as antiquated as the establishment..Comfort food? Only if you are comfortable with ghetto crap food . Sorry Charlie (and Don)",0

295,0,"I must agree with Scott S, but I should point out that I'm probably even less qualified to write a review of this place as I didn't eat here... I merely wandered in and right back out. \n\nGone is the crowd and the long wait on a weekend morning waiting for a Pischke's greasy and tasty breakfast. Gone is the kitschy decor that gave the place character. Gone are the sassy waitresses who looked like they needed a good night sleep. Gone are the bursting menus full of good eats at reasonable prices.\n\nReplacing all of this is a bland and boring decor, 50% fewer menu choices, and 50% higher prices. The place was pretty empty while every other breakfast place in the neighborhood (we drove past 5 others) was packed with a line going out the door. Here's a tip for Mr Robert McGrath - if you buy a successful restaurant, don't make drastic changes and jack up the prices... in other words - if it ain't broke, don't fix it. \n\nI'm actually kinda pissed too because I thought Pischke's was pretty good and it was definitely adding character to our city... what's there now is just another boring restaurant. There's plenty of those around here... Pischke's was unique to the area. When I visit my sister in Minnesota, she has some really neat breakfast places she takes me to that are decorated as an eclectic mess, but that blow you away with good greasy food and are dripping with atmosphere and fun. Same story when I go to San Diego or Long Beach to visit friends. Neat hip cities have neat hip breakfast joints. Well now we have one fewer. \n\nIt's true - I haven't eaten here and perhaps Robert McGrath makes the most bomb-ass bacon and eggs this side of the equator... but it would seriously have to blow my mind to put this place back on my list of places to go. The empty seats told me the story anyway. Before I left, I told the hostess to put it back the way it was. \n\nI plan to actually have a meal there sometime and then post a proper review... until then, this will have to do.",0

It was actually yesterday when we went over again to get rid of some stress and get an hour long massage. When it was all said and done, we were about to pay $90 for the both of us. Keep in mind that the massages are $38/hour, so that times two is $76. I left a $14 tip which is 15%, and most places would be happy, but not this time. The gentleman that gave me a massage looked at me and said \""really? only this much?\"". It was one of the most insulting things in my life, especially at a place I went to relieve some stress.\n\nDon't get me wrong though, the massages were amazing, they did awesome work on both me and my fiance. The lady that gave my fiance a massage was FURIOUS when she heard how much we wanted to tip, and the guy was doing his best to hurry us out, so I was like well okay fine, I'll give you guys $100 ($24 tip). He told me people always tipped at least $10. Really? Just because everyone wants to tip 30% does that mean that I'm a loser for tipping 15%? We went in there to be stress free and this only made me feel worse, both me and my fiance felt like horrible people...\n\nI hope the extra few dollars were worth permanently losing some customers. We decided we're never coming here again, I guess we have to find somewhere else to go for awesome massages.",0

When I called the office they said they do the \""best they can\"" in scheduling appointments so that the insurance covers it but there are over 1100 insurance companies and they are \""not perfect\"".  Funny, I have been going to the dentist for years and have NEVER had to pay for a cleaning!  And for the nasty billing letter threatening to turn me over to collections ...  I MUST have received the other bills because they show they mailed them!   This place has gotten roughly $2000 from me in 1 year and $850 (+$82 now) out of my own pocket.

While the restaurant is billed as \""authentically Italian\"", in my opinion, it's far more Italian-American than traditional Italian fare (fine, if that's your thing).  Reminds me of the \""red sauce\"" Italian places you find commonly in NYC.\n\nFirst up was a mozzarella di buffala with tomatoes and basil - a simple, classic dish that I love to make at home.  The dish was edible but the cheese was too firm, the olive oil was thin and watery and finally the basil was chopped too finely to be tasted.\n\nTwo pizzas were up for dinner, the Toscana with prosciutto, arugula and diced tomatoes and the \""chef's special\"" with Italian sausage, rapini and parmigiano.  The first was fresh and tasty but a little uneventful.  The second was loaded with a cheap, salty parmigiano cheese that overwhelmed the flavours of the other ingredients.\n\nThe bring-your-own-wine, cash-only bit is a bit downscale given the prices.

This place is close to my work so I'm here at least twice a week for cheap produce and reasonably priced meats.  The selection is still great, and I've noticed over the months that more and more non-Latinos shop here!  Good job people!  Cheapy like me!  Their produce prices sure beat the local Albertson's and Vons and Smith's by a long shot.  The only other place I get veggies is the Asian market but that's only because those yummy types of veggies aren't found here at Cardenas.  Go ahead, ask the stocker where they keep the baby bok choy and the fragrant pears!  You will get a look of confusion.  Well, that could also be because the stocker doesn't understand English very well.  In either case, you're out of luck.\n\nCardenas is still mostly one stop shop for your Mexican needs.  Besides the large supermarket area, you still have your juice bar, bakery, deli, and tortilleria stations within the store.  The tortillas here are pretty good, I'm spoiled now...I only buy fresh made corn tortillas from the tortilleria for my tacos!  They taste 100 times better when they are made only a few hours ago.  Really makes a difference in your Mexican dishes.\n\nThe juice bar is tasty, with fresh concoctions of strawberry and watermelon juices, or a fresh fruit smoothie.  It's better if you know a bit of Spanish because the drink orders can get confusing.  Got what I thought was supposed to be a strawberry smoothie, but they for some reason added beets!  Tastier than I thought it would be but still, could have done without them.\n\nCardenas bakery goes all day long.  When you enter the store you constantly smell the aroma of fresh bread or pastries coming out of the oven.  Tip, always ask for the freshest stuff out of the ovens (usually will be on trays where the ovens are).  I find that sometimes the pastries in the case can be sitting there for a while, and Lord knows who's been touching them or who's kids boogie face got on them.  A sign that says 'Please use tongs' doesn't always fit the bill!\n\nI am often here for a quick lunch at the Cardenas deli, especially when they run their weekly specials.  $5 sale for a burrito al pastor?  $3 for a ham torta?  Often with a free drink?  I'm there!  I enjoy most of the fare at Cardenas, and it's great they have a free salsa bar to partake with each meal.  As of late, they have taken out the sliced cucumbers and sliced radishes that used to be regulars at the bar...but it's ok.  They probably had to because of food cost, or because of people like me who love to stock up for some healthy snacking!  No problem though, looks like more pickled jalapenos for me!  I am probably there for food at least 5-6 times a month.  I love me a torta with a mix of tomatillo salsa and Cardenas hot sauce for dipping.  MUY DELICIOSO!\n\nCheap and easy, that's my motto.  Well, for grocery shopping at least.  Cardenas fits that nicely.  If you see me there, come by and say \""Hola!\""  I might just be able to understand you.",4

311,0,"Ate here last year and had a terribly inattentive, condescending server and the food was just okay.  We asked for them to omit some spicy tuna from one of their specialty rolls and he gave us so much attitude about it we almost left.\n\nI was back in town again this week and gave RA another try for dinner with a group of 5.  First  of all, it is WAY too loud in there.  The music is turned up so high, we had to scream at each other just to have a conversation.  As soon as we sat down, they turned the lights down so low we could not read the menus.  Luckily, we are A/V techs working in town and we all had our flashlights handy.   You would think seeing a table full of flashlights would clue them in to turn the lights up again, but no such luck.\n\nWe had already been waiting quite a while when our waitress came and asked us if we would mind waiting some more so she could finish with another table.  When she finally got our table going, our beers were served warm (it was 110 degrees outside) and we had to ask for glasses for them.  When she took the food order, she couldn't hear one end of the table. After shouting back and forth with bad results, we had to suggest she come around to the other end of the table so she could hear us better.  The worst part came when the entire group had been served, except for one of us.  When we inquired about this she said - and this is verbatim - 'If we waited to bring it out until it was all ready, the fish would go bad'.  We also received our appetizer AFTER we had finished our meal, with no apology or explanation. \n\nIf the food was amazing I would say putting up with all this was tolerable, but it just isn't.  The servings are skimpy and there is more rice than anything else in most rolls.  Their specialty rolls are not even served with wasabi or ginger.  The failed mexi-japanese fusion menu is more flash than fish.  \n\nI sincerely hope the owners and management have more experience expediting a kitchen than our experience indicated, or that the waitress seemed to be aware of.  I've never heard such a ridiculous excuse for guests not being served at the same time.  Never, ever again.",0

Besides that, Pure has made the decision to turn the entire place into nothing but tables and bottle service. Everywhere you go there must have been a table to the left or right of you. Leaving no space to stand or dance or wait for a drink.  The second floor outside area, didn't get any better. For the 20 minutes we were there before we decided to leave, it was like we were walking in narrow hallways of VIP rope.

As is normal, we tend to remember negative experiences more as good service is always expected.\n    I have to say though this is your average run of the mill sub shop, nothing that will stand out and say man I love this place!

318,0,"We visited this Applebee's location last night.  We were out running errands, it was getting late, and this location is right around the corner from the house.  \n\nThe food is average for a chain.  You know what you're gonna get no matter what location you go to.  The service however is hit or miss...and last night the service missed the mark by a mile!\n\nOur waiter got to our table and asked for our drink order.  Good deal.  We order when he returns with our drinks.  \n  \nJ's order - Fajitas. \nMy order - Oriental Chicken Salad\nBaby C's order - Kids Meal Grilled chicken sandwich  (Kids Eat Free on Tuesdays)\n\nOur server, Michael,  runs off before I'm able to state..uhhh...the kids meal comes with a drink and side!!  We have to flag him down.  We state...we didn't have a chance to order the drink or side for our son.  He's like...oh i ordered him fries.  I'll have to go change it.  \n\nREALLY!?  I'm so sorry to inconvenience you!!  And I'm glad you think you know better than I do what I wanna feed MY CHILD!  Wow!  How perceptive of you...ya dumbazz!!  I order Baby C some steamed broccoli and a juice.  \n\nJ's and my food come out as ordered.  Baby C's is MIA.  A few minutes later his sandwich is brought out....with an applesauce.  Again I have to flag down the server so the correction can be made.  About 5 minutes later we get a side of over steamed broccoli...but whatever.  Baby C doesn't seem to mind.  \n\nDrinks...he's on the ball with refills of my water.  But misses the mark with J's root beer refill.  He brings him Dr. Pepper instead.  And then when J says...hey this is Dr. Pepper, not Root Beer.  The server is like..you ordered Dr. Pepper though, right?  WRONG!  \n\nThen we had to wait around for the check and for him to run my card.  It was funny, but I was looking around and spotted the servers other tables.  The one right next to us didn't seem happy either with the service.  In fact they seemed pretty pissed.  \n\nI sure hope we get a different server if and when we ever return.",0
319,0,"Location: hidden in a small complex near a salon, subway, and next door to Bachi Burger. \n\nAfter our party was waiting for what seemed an eternity at Bachi Burger, we decided to go to its sister place, Ramen Shoku.  Simply put, I most likely, not probably, won't be back here again. The various appetizers including the GYOZA and TAKOYAKI was somewhat interesting, but nothing too exciting to do an order of again.  Each of us  had something different...TONKOTSU, SPICY MISO, and I had the most touted TAN TAN MEN ramen for 11.50.  It was overly salty and the noodles were too al dente.  I couldn't get past the overly salty taste of the soup and it seemed that every time I had the soup, I would be grappling for the water as a chaser.  The menu stated spciy base, but they need to edit it and put salty base.  I almost wanted to add the carafe of water into the soup and ask them to heat the soup along with the al dente noodles to cook some more.  The overpowering taste of salt definitely made me want to walk out that door and not even consider ramen places in general.  I think the SPICY RAMEN was more up my alley as it had more flavor from the miso base.  The base of the TAN TAN MEN was just simply oxtail soup which would have been more preferable than what they had added to it.  It definitely helped me to eat less, but then again helped me to cross this off my list or put it on my list of places to never go back again.  \n\nNext time, I'll wait for Bachi Burger even if it's an hour long wait...there's a reason why this place was barely empty and the Bachi was filled to the brim.  You'll enjoy drinking water at this place.",0

322,0,Meh!! This is a typical AZ hyped up joint. I have eaten here twice. Both times have left much to desire. First off the bread was toooo freakin thick. The meats are not very high quality in flavor or texture. I just don't get why people think it's sooo good. I have some good sandwiches in my life from some of the most famous in NY and LA to San diego and SF. This place sucks in comparison to most. Not my kind of place.

323,0,"Another review liken this 'animal hospital' to a dealership. In a way I agree, except that comparison may be giving Centennial Hills Animal Hospital (CHAM) too much credit and is too unfair to dealerships. \n\nThe experience is so unpleasant I don't actually want to author this review. It is possible that for the purposes of routine shots and other 40$ treatments/procedures/matters, this animal hospital is perfectly fine. You may want to consider if it is fine or not, but I don't believe for larger, serious procedures (surgery) you should consider CHAM at all. If you are reading this because there may be something seriously wrong with your smaller animal friend, and your first choice is not to kill them, start looking for a different option now. Don't even finish reading this overly long review; just look for another Animal Hospital, please. You're welcome.\n\nThe cat that lives with us was sick. She was vomiting constantly, quite violently. We meant to take her to a higher rated Animal Hospital that is in the same area, but there was an error committed in mapping out the directions so we came to CHAM instead. What followed was the doctor taking a series of xrays (one of which was taken incorrectly, which I had to pay to have retaken at another hospital) and going to the HIGH side of a quote instantaneously. Her recommendation was so extreme (barium GI tract exploration) that the other hospital would not even believe that it was recommended by a veterinarian.  \n\nWhen we asked if it were possible that the xrays results be given to us in hard form so we could get another opinion when the veterinarian was going to show us her findings (this is post-the barium recommendation), she abruptly shut down the presentation/sales pitch for barium and stormed out of the room. It was like a bad SNL skit (think Will Ferrell as a doctor). \n\nThey charged an extra 5$ for the CD that the xray results were placed in. \n\nIn the end, the poor cat was just constipated. You can't make this shit up. - E",0
324,0,"I am not originally from NY, but I can appreciate a good bagel...and these bagels are pretty good.  The cream cheese flavors are also very good and made with fresh ingredients.  My favorite is the Bacon, Tomato and Scallion...real bacon, fesh tomatoe and slices of green onion.  My son tried the Chocolate Chip and the flavor was a bit flat.  Not bad, but not WOW....which is what we were hoping for.  We have also tried the Green Olive and Pimento and that was good, too.  My husband likes the Cheddar and Jalapeno, chock full of sliced fresh jalapeno...seeds and all.   \n\nI have been there for lunch a couple of times and have tried their Italian sub and Veggie wrap...both were really good!  They serve Boar's Head meats.\n\nThey also have a great selection of desserts and beverages.  The coffee is ok.  My son liked the Black & White and M&M cookies.",2
325,0,"Man, I really want this place to be good... but it's not.  A shame - it's so convenient to get delivery (especially when it snowed, hah).  Quintessential Chinese take-out isn't all that great in the first place, but Cherry House's dishes don't even measure up to that standard.\n\nProbably the most annoying thing about the beef, chicken, or shrimp entrees is the abundance of vegetables.  Don't get me wrong - I love my greens, but there just isn't much in the way of protein.  Having ordered a variety of entrees, each of them just go overkill with the veggies.  You feel cheated - the dishes should be along the lines of \""snow peas, carrots, and a sampling of shrimp.\""  And to make matters worse, despite the diversity of dishes available, there's about three flavor profiles available:  (1) salty; (2) sweet; and (3) sweet and salty. \n\nHot and Sour Soup - They're doing it wrong.  The viscosity is off, and it's neither hot nor sour, really.  \n\nWhen my sister visited and tried this place, she said everything from there tastes like broom handle.  I've never had the pleasure of trying broom handle (and I don't know how she would know...) but I take it that it's no filet.\n\nFor me, the coup de grace was hair in my food the last two times I ordered!

327,0,"Fresh, \""real\"" food made by some of the nicest people in Las Vegas. Don't be put off by the location in a mall.

This is on top of the hefty $40 per adult charge.\n - Changing Rooms. Little to no clothes changing stalls in both male and female bathrooms; very few showers.\n - Entry.

You have to haul your own float tube to the top of the rides - no conveyor belt to assist in getting the tube to the top\n - Wait time - longish lines (without the line jump band) meant a long wait between fun rides.\n - Special salt water conditioning system in pools is harsh on swim suits - my daughter's dark pink suit came home very light pink\n\nTip:\n* Take your own shade and chairs - those are in short supply\n* Be sure to wear flip-flops or watershoes to all the rides - there is a LOT of non-shaded cement and it gets very hot.",2

334,0,"The place was charming, and we enjoyed the food, particularly the brats and sweet potato fries, but to call it a serious restaurant is a bit much, since the fare is mostly pub food.  Our main objection is that the music is too loud and the sound system is terrible.",2

The dosa special is exactly the same for lunch & dinner, so I usually get it for lunch, and the grill one is better for dinner (a couple of extra sides compared to lunch.)\n\nAt lunch, sometimes the chutney bar isn't completely ready yet, but it's always been stocked at dinner time. Also, the focus is definitely on the food and not the decor or tableware. The one odd thing about this place is that the kitchen staff seems to speak in Spanish...

Everyone else including the hosts acted classy and to the caliber expected of the restaurant.  The people who pour the drinks take great care in even testing what they pour.  They are extremely knowledgeable and honest outside our waiter. The waiter basically made up answers when asking him a question.\n\n1. Asked about Absinthe and if the Absinthe sold is the type that gives you hallucinations (made with wormwood has Thujone as the active ingredient).\nWaiter replies. \"" NO government all around the world would ever allow any drugs like that to be sold to anyone.\"" I reply \""Salvia\"".  Weird awkward silence.\n\nThen he goes on a rant how wormwood isn't an active ingredient for that and he's smoked tons of it with no effect...  I don't expect waiters to know the chemistry of smoking something rather than brewing something, but for a $20 glass of absinthe it makes Sage look like it's joke when it's suppose to be a classy place.\n\n We do not allow the chemical Thujone from the woodworm brewing method to be included in Absinthe sold in the United States. Strictly for the reason of the effects it has on the body.  For him to say all the absinthe at Sage was brewed the exact same way as it was 100 years ago is ridiculous, unless they are breaking the law.\n\n2. We asked the water guy what type of tea it is they serve.  He brought out the actual can as he wasn't too sure.  Super helpful super friendly. \nSo we ask the same waiter.  He say's \""Well it's a secret blend that only sales to exclusive rock star hotels like us\"".  As he's saying that I'm looking up the exact same can of tea on my phone.

On top of that maintenance drops by nails your door frames together then tells you it will be 2 days before it  will be completely fixed. Such bullshit!  I'm sorry for the others that got robbed and it's sad that I can't just up and leave due to contractual obligations.

Also, our steaks, while cooked to order, lacked flavor.\n\nOn the good end, we loved the setting. The decorations and mood was nice. The fries were good, the seasonal beer was great (3 dollar draft at happy hour) and the baked potato was outstanding.\n\nWe probably won't be back, but it'd be worth trying if you find the right deal or like their menu options.

It's a much bigger space than I expected, and they really efficiently take care of everyone with the team service.

All of this amidst a small bar, brick detailing, and a fancily upholstered booth parallel to the kitchen, where chefs can be seen whisking, flipping, and plating away.  The burger was one of the best in the valley, with a choice of fries or arugula salad (I chose the healthy option this time).

They are usualy very busy and packed though, but because of their small size they can't accommodate a large volume.\n\nThey have their staple foods like wasabi kobe beef, bacon wrapped asparagus, their 1/2 cold 1/2 fried tofu, and of course their daily specials. I always try to get atleast 1 dish off their specials. Be sure to get any of their whole fish whenever it's offered. They serve half of it sashimi style and the pieces literally melt in your mouth.

I take my 3 year old there after a long day at work because I promised her a mommy day. I walk in and explain she doesn't really need a pedi just her nails painted. He tells me $5 and as my daughter runs over to the kid chairs (which no one was using or waiting for) stops her and tells her she can't sit in a chair unless she gets an actual pedicure. My daughter bursts into tears and he tells her \""too bad\"" ASSHOLE!\n\nI walked out and went across the street to Angel Touch Nails. They gladly accommodated me and my daughter and let her sit in a chair\nEven tho they don't have the kid ones. \n\nPeople take their hard earned money places to have experiences! It's not just about\nThe money people. This business should be ashamed!",0

It's become a staple for myself and friends before concerts or Pens games. \nIt can get extremely busy before events, so arrive early. On the plus side, you'll be able to save yourself a few bucks from expensive arena prices.\nAll the food I've had has been good. I like to judge a bar food by their chicken fingers and french fries. Both are delicious. \nIf you want a real Pittsburgh feel this is the place for you! :)",4
363,0,"Stayed here recently because we got married in Caesars Palace. We stayed in a \""deluxe room\"" in the Augustus Tower. We originally werent placed there but our taxi driver said to ask for that tower cause it over looks the Bellagio water show. Well we got the tower... but on the wrong side. Instead of seeing the water show, we got to see the roof of the building under us. Oh well.\n\nThe room was HUGE. I wish I had taken pictures. The bathroom was HUGE!!! The bathtub had jets in them and there was a tv on the opposite side of the tub! Watching tv while taking a shower was an amazing experience haha.\n\nThe bed was so comfortable and the pillows were amazing. I wish I knew what type they were so I could buy some! Our room was right next to the hallway where people get off the elevator (why do we always get placed near the elevator) but it was quiet. \n\nOverall, I would definitely stay here again!!",4

The owner/manager (not sure) made it a point to come by and ask us how we were doing, and informed us that they were getting their AC fixed as soon as possible. He was also offering more than the one dessert per person because of the heat. I liked that he was concerned about the well-being and comfort of his patrons. \n\nAnyway, I have to say that this place delivers. Their hamachi was pretty fresh, and their appetizers and selection had a lot of variety. I liked the tuna carpaccio, and a few other things that I can't remember the names of.

366,0,"Stay away from Caesars Palace! I have stayed at Caesars Palace several times before and each time my experiences get worse and worse. I continued to stay there because of location but if you are going to spend over $500 a night on a room don't spend it at Caesars, go to the Venetian, or the Wynn properties. The VIP check in clerk was completely incompetent. When he looked up my reservation he asked me if i knew how much the rates were even though i had already paid the first night, frankly insulting. He gave us a smoking floor room when my wife has bad asthma and I had requested a non smoking room. He never took my credit card information when I handed it to him at check in, and was woke up at 7:30am to put a credit card down. Food Court was slow and serves cold food. Room service was ridiculous. They got our order wrong every time, and it took at least 1 hour plus for delivery of the cold food you pay an arm and leg for, and I got two harassing phone calls asking us to immediately put the cart back in the hallway (one of the phone call the cart was already outside). Our room had a broken lamp that flickered off and on all day. I really got the overwhilming impression they do not care about people anymore only the bottom line.",0

I did notice that not all the chefs gave it as much effort or were as excited as ours; we must have gotten lucky. The food was delicious. The fried rice was yummy as well as our main course. We chose the dinner for two, so we got to pick four meats. We chose filet mignon, shrimp, sword fish, and calamari. Everything was great! Although I was a bit confused when out chef served us the calamari, I was expecting a tiny intact squid, it looked like a slab of fish, but it was delicious none the less. It did seem however that a majority of the crowd was getting extremely drunk, they were shouting across the room and talking very loudly. There was a couple of families there with young children, which might have been more appropriate at a table instead of the grill because the chefs play with fire and squirts saki in your mouth. The prices are a bit high, but you get what you pay for, I was barely able to finish all the food they have me!! Overall it was a fun night and yummy food. I am looking forward to going back.",4

I've always been pleased with the car wash, and it's never taken too terribly long. But I took my car there last week, and I finally had an encounter with the man trying to sell windshields. My car is two years old and my windshield doesn't even have one rock chip in it! It is in perfect condition! He was really pushy, saying how my windshield is dangerous and asking for the name of my insurance company (seriously!). Well, I've now lost all respect for Classic Car Spa after that happened. Why would a reputable business be associated with a snake oil salesman? I won't be going back after my groupon car washes run out.",0

373,0,"In the worst of times people often think of the best of times.  Rex is no exception.  Gather around kids and let Uncle Rex tell you a story...when Rex was a small child he spent many a month on the East Coast. It was a magical time.  My father, who beat young Rex mercilessly if Rex called him anything but \""The Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora\"", was originally from the Northeast.  My father was an odd man, a brutal man, a man with big dreams and small child like hands.  On my fifth birthday he brought Rex with him as he knocked over a 7-11.  As Rex helped him tie up the store clerk he let me pick any one thing Rex wanted in the store.  Young Rex wandered around the store, trying very hard to not step in the pools of blood, Rex saw the object he wanted...Rex turned and said \""Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora can Rex have THAT?\""  He nodded.  Rex kicked the 87 year old man laying on some of it...and picked it up. It was a bag with a delicious cheesesteak in it.  Rex danced. Rex smiled. Rex took the wallet of a crying soccer dad.  Rex was happy.  Rex and Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora drove down the street, the sound of sirens in the distance fading...the smell of the cheesesteak wafting into Rex's young nasal passages.  A great cheesesteak is a gift from above.  A wallet filled with 20 dollar bills and an unused condom...icing on the cake.  After we divided the ill gotten booty, Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora always took 70% (until I turned 9...but that is another story)...Rex ate his cheesesteak.  Perfect bread. Juicy shredded meat. Perfectly cooked onions. The right amount of whiz. Juice ran down Rex's chin. Juice ran down Rex's hands. Rex shook in delight. That memory, and the 8 months Rex spent on the run after Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora ratted him out...will always be with him.\n\nPops Philly Cheesesteak is not only an insult to that memory it is an insult to all things with meat, cheese, bread or even hot foods.  The front page of the their website has a picture of their pitiful attempt of a cheeesteak...one of one of their abominations has green pepper on it. GREEN PEPPER!!  Let me explain something to all of you who are not from Philly...IF there was a place in Philadelphia that put green bell peppers on their cheeseteak...THE CITIZENS WOULD BURN IT DOWN!!!  It is ABSOLUTLEY 100% NOT ALLOWED IN ANY PLACE IN PHILADELPHIA!! Even if asked they WILL NOT DO IT!  So, first and foremost this is NOT A PHILLY CHEESESTEAK PLACE!!! IT IS NOT! END OF STORY!\n\nApologies. Rex passed out and needed a shot of \""Happy Serum\"" to get up right again...what is \""Happy Serum\"" you ask...heathen...it is 1 part gasoline, 1 part peach schnapps, 1 part wiper fluid. \n\nAnyway, now that we have established this is not a Philly cheesesteak, let's talk about it from a cheesesteak on it's own merits.  First, the rolls are good, the sad part is you can tell the bread is shipped frozen or frozen after it gets to Pops.  Big mistake. It really messes with the bread. It isn't bad, but again it isn't East Coast good.  Cheese...never enough. Never. If you get provolone instead of whiz it is almost non-existent. Shame on you for skimping on the cheese.  The Whiz isn't bad sometimes but more often than not there isn't enough.  The meat isn't bad. It is done well, with one BIG problem...it is often dry. Not enough oil or cooked and then recooked, whatever the reason it is not great.  If you get to Pops on the right day and get lucky, and order correctly, it isn't bad...but the overall consistency is not there.\n\nLastly...the \""Philly\"" part of the menu...the Tastycakes, the birch beer, the rest of it...all WAY TOO EXPENSIVE! At Glaziers Market you can get all the stuff for 1/5th of the price.  \n\nHere is my biggest problem...Pop's plays on East Coast memories and locals who don't know any better. That is the biggest crime. It isn't Philly. It isn't a great cheesesteak. It is over priced. It is inconsistent. It just isn't right. It just isn't good.  Most of you will never know better unless you go back east (and my next review for Pizza will tell you how to find GREAT east coast food), and they KNOW you don't know. Pop's has been a place I have tried off and on for almost 8 years.  Rex wants to love it. Rex needs to keep trying every 2 years or so...but much like when his father turned him into the cops at the tender age of 5...Rex is always hurt by Pops. Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora and Pops...shame on you...you know better. Rex knows better. Rex deserves better. So does everyone else.",0
374,0,"Horrible horrible horrible customer service. I wouldn't recommend their services to my worst enemy. They are incompetent and lack knowledge.\n\nI had an alignment done on the car after a major suspension overhaul and they tried to tell me my parts were worn out and couldn't get it into specs. The alignment they performed was tolerable for a few months and then I noticed my inner tires were wearing unevenly. Brought it back in since the alignment had a year warranty. I drop the car off and get a call 15 minutes later blaming me for replacing more suspension parts and my warranty was voided now. I went back into the store and politely told them I hadn't replaced anything after the initial alignment was performed. The tech continued to blame me and even called me a liar once. After a bit more uncomfortable arguing they agreed to finish the alignment. Once it was completed I had the guy at the register to never bring my car back to there store. I brushed that comment off and drove the car home with a new violent pull to the right. The tech mustve intentionally ruined they alignment due to little bitch syndrome. Had to bring my car to a friend and had the alignment fixed and within almost perfect specs. They had no reason to treat me like a criminal when I was clearly a paying customer! Screw these losers, I hope they lose their business and someone better moves in like discount tire.\n\nEveryone that lives in Mtns Edge should steer clear of this crap tire shop.

We have limited delivery in our area and we wanted to try something different than your typical fast food chain delivery. Our experience was terrible. We live about ten minutes away and it took over an hour and 15 min get get our order. The caesar salad arrived with dressing on it that was like 3 times the amount of dressing anyone would want on their salad! Who delivers a salad with dressing on it? The pizza was vile. It tasted like soggy cardboard. There was no flavor what so ever and the basil on the too was charred and you couldn't even tell it was suppose to be green. Will not be visiting again.,0

Had some tasty cheeses that were served with a cherry paste sort of thing. \n\nThe wait is long, but I give them credit for using a text message system that even lets you track how many parties are in front of you. The outside area is surprisingly cool, even in the depths of summer (at least around 9pm, when it was still 95 or so outside) thanks to powerful fans and good misting. \n\nThe food is pretty good. I like the pretzel bread fondue and my go-to meal is the fried chicken, which is really juicy, though I wish they'd put a bit more into the mashed potatoes/gravy they have going on.\n\nThe Yard has live music pretty often, and on our visit, this was a pretty serious disadvantage. It wasn't just that it was loud. It was loud and pretty awful. Lots of different covers spanning all kinds of genres ensured that we'd hear some of our favorite hits from the 60s, 70s, and 90s butchered.

We ordered beers, which were $5 for craft beer pints. Beer choices here are good. For HH prices though, I wasn't too impressed. Appetizers are still between $5-10.\n\nFor dinner, I ordered the Wrangler burger and fries. I was told to stay far away from the coleslaw, as recommended by our server.

It was 8:50 P.M., on a Saturday night, and I wanted to reward myself with a nice dinner. With the Feast Buffet closing, I stepped into another Station Casinos icon: The Grand Cafe. Unfortunately nothing about it is Grand.\n\n  The Grand Cafe of today trails behind the Grand Cafe of a few years past in value. With the exception of their daily special, the prices are inflated. Gone are the entrees that include a cup of soup. My dinner: fettuccine, bread, cream of mushroom soup, cola, and tip came to $17. For that price, I would prefer Olive Garden or Red Lobster. \n\n  There were a couple issues that caused me to lower the review by half a star. Far too much of the fettuccine was taken up by bread. Attention to beverage refills was slow.\n\n  My impression of the Grand Cafe is it is a convenient 24 hour restaurant to grab a bite in Santa Fe Station. And, if I am not mistaken, Grand Cafe is the go-to place for desserts in Santa Fe Station.\n\n These are my recommendations for the Grand Cafe management to improve their restaurant. Offer more items, lower the pricing, include soup with all entrees, and provide better refill service on beverages.",2

I honestly have no idea on Afghan culture let alone on their cuisine, so this was a great intro to their stuff. Like I said their food blew me away.

The korma was splendid and my husband's sabzi poolao (spinach one) looked and tasted great too. \n\nOh plus you can BYOW here and apparently they have a cave decor on the other side of the resto thats only open during Fri's and Sat's.\n\nAnyway I cant guarantee on the authencity of the cuisine itself, but it did give me good positive feel on it.

As for my friend, she was really hoping to get the garden crepes.  So when the server came our way to take the order she went back to ask the cook if she wouldn't mind making it for her and the answer was something along the lines of 'Sure, I'll make it.'  Big props for making these two customers feel happy about that.

We weren't allowed to go in until the ppl who made the reservation arrived. \n\nOnce seated there was no friendly host or waitress to advise us of what was available or how things worked. Our waitress was clearly not enjoying her job that day and it should as she shoveled water glasses onto our table, reached across us, and did not bother to apologize. \n\nThere was not a huge selection of food. Everything LOOKED beautiful but tasted a little on the bland side. We were there for brunch but caught the beginning portions of lunch - still no improvement on the food. Best thing I ate was a croissant bc it was warm and fresh from the oven, slightly crunchy on the outside - yum. But sad that in a buffet so fancy and acclaimed; i had a good croissant and that was it.",0

No parking, plus all the crazy angry Asian drivers.\n\nThe sat us at a table by the entrance, so while we were eating people were standing by us waiting and just looking which is SUPER awkward. The tea cup and spoons were not washed thoroughly. They had some weird stuff on them. They were also hosting a party in one of their side rooms which is annoying because they reserved the room on a really busy night. Which meant that they got to enjoy themselves and not really have to wait when everyone else were crammed in the main room.\n\nI would have given this place two stars, but I understand that it was super busy and that they were doing their best. I felt bad for one of the service people because she was kind of old and she was running back and forth trying to service everyone.\n\nThe food was ok for me but my parents love how the food taste, but they don't really know how to eat.",0

So I called and was told to return to registration for a new room, meaning that I had to lug the bags all the way back to the registration desk.

412,0,"Located at the corner of S. Jones and Spring Mountain near the 168 Market, this small humble eatery provides a comprehensive array of Taiwanese breakfast items that elicit childhood nostalgia for many 1st generation Taiwanese/Chinese folks and are definitely on the must-eat list for those of us second-generation folks who have been fortunate to have made a pilgrimmage back to Taiwan (or as I like to call it, Foodie Island).  \n\nSoybean milk-  this is not the chalky stuff that you find in your supermarket that adds a nice dimension to your latte or cereal, this is enjoyed straight up either as a sweetened cold/hot beverage or in a savory form where a shot of vinegar and soy triggers a reaction so that the soymilk takes on a creamy custardization accented by little bits of green onion and pickled veggies.  For those with discernible palates, I've been informed by reputable sources that the soybean milk across the street at China Mama is superior.\n\nRice Ball (Fan Twan)- a classic item my parents used to grab on the go while heading to school, don't be fooled by the simple name.  This is steamed sticky rice enclosing a savory deep fried chinese doughnut and pork sung.  The ratio of the rice and filling is perfect and it's as classic a combination as pb and j.\n\nTemple meatball (Ba Wan)-  not sure if there are any other places in town that offer this, and fortunately they make a wonderful version of this popular street food item.    Finely chopped mushrooms, bamboo, and stir-fried pork encased by a glutinous tapioca flour bun and bathed in a thick orange sweet savory sauce that has an additional note similar to cinnamon/star anise, this one will flood your head with umami and makes me think if boba and dim sum were to conceive a rockstar child, this would be it.\n\nSpicy Beef Noodle soup-   Served piping hot and can easily feed 2 or more, the meat is impeccably braised and comes with garnishes of pickled mustard greens, cilantro, scallions, and bok choy.  Detractors might say it is on the oily side and is way spicy (in which case the version at Noodle Pot may be closer to your liking), otherwise this one punches you in the face and is not shy on flavor in the best way possible.\n\nLeek Pancake- A deep-fried empanada filled with garlic chives, scrambled egg, tofu, and mung bean noodles, this is a tasty rendition if you really like garlic chives.\n\nItems that have room for improvement include the savory chinese doughnuts (yiotiao) and the sesame bun (sao bing) which I found to be a tad bit on the dry side, and the hunk of pork in the pork bun (gua bao) is also a bit oversized and lacking unctuousness (Sheridan Su does a better rendition at Great Bao which is now Fat Choy).  Looking forward to trying the pork chop with rice, sweet tofu custard (do hua), and the lotus wrapped tamales (taiwanese and shanghainese varieties available) on future visits. \n\nNot sure if this is an outpost of Yi Mei Deli Co. in Rowland Heights, CA (the fonts on the food signs look similar), but if you're expecting the same level of quality, it may come up short since they set the bar extremely high, otherwise it's a great primer on Taiwanese cuisine for the uninitiated.  Unbelievable value for your wallet but don't forget cash if you're spending under $10 and they accept visa/mastercard but no amex.",4

I liked my therapist on the whole, and I've felt like I was taken decent care of. \n\nHowever, the practice has a rather draconian appointment-cancellation fee. It doesn't seem to matter that I have paid them countless $35.00 co-pays (ludicrous and laughable, I know... but that's between me and my wicked insurance provider) and that I call them if I I'm so much as stuck at a traffic light and will be five minutes late... we are battling to the death over an alleged no-show appointment that I swear upwards and down I rescheduled prior to not attending.  The billing manager will not let it go, and insists that I must pay this fee, no matter how many conversations we have about it.\n\nThe point here is, folks: isn't it worth it to keep your customers happy? I know I didn't miss this appointment... but even if I did, I had countless sessions at this facility. I was always on time, and I always paid at the time of service.

I think they have PBR cans on special everyday though, not sure. \n\nFood is pretty great, I like the hot dogs, the fish & chips, and their mac & cheese is really good.

Oh, it was wrong. \n\nSince the non-smoking laws passed, obviously there are no more issues with the bar being super smoky. however they still have, in the ceiling, what I THINK is a smoke-eater machine?

That's right McDonald's is better which is the only time I have or will ever say that.  Their burger was flavorless and had the same consistency as burgers you find in the frozen dinner isle at Walmart. They have a lot of bells and whistles.

422,0,"My wife and I heard many good things about Mesa Grill, so we decided to give it a try.  We went in around noon for lunch on a Thursday and the restaurant was pretty empty.  The waiter promptly told us the specials and asked if we know who Bobby Flay is.  It seems like they are trained to talk about the Iron Chef.\n\nWe ordered the SHRIMP + ROASTED GARLIC CORN TAMALE for appetizer, ANCHO CHILE-HONEY GLAZED SALMON, and GREEN CHILE BURGER for entrees.\n\nSince Bobby Flay is known for his sauces, the tamale came with a very creamy garlic sauce that complements the entire dish.  For the salmon, it came with a light black bean, bbq, and honey sauce.  Also, it is topped with fresh green salsa that refreshes the palate with every bite.  My wife stated that it was the best salmon she's ever had.  The green chile burger is also very interesting.  The sour component that usually comes from ketchup is replaced with green chile instead.  The patty is also very tasty and moist.\n\nOverall, we really enjoy the food and the service at Mesa Grill.  We will definitely visit it again when we come back to Las Vegas.",3

Ended up getting the 3-meat platter with the Turkey, Brisket, and Ribs - mashed potatoes and cornbread for the sides.  The food came out quickly as it was pretty slow for an early Tuesday night.  Everything was wonderful.  The brisket was sliced thin.. the ribs fell off the bone.. and the turkey was juicy and flavorful.  Potatoes and cornbread were good though they were just sides and my main focus was on the meat.  \n\nThe service was great.. our server Madison was very friendly and attentive.  The place itself was nice looking with a modern/rustic look - the wooden tables and lighting were quite nice.

There was practically one seafood section at the time I was there, so the line got soooo long just get some shrimp and crab legs. I guess the JUMBO shrimp and fresh crabs paid the bill for me ($35 a person for brunch).

There was a large variety of food all of which were good.

430,0,"Let me first start off by saying we did not schedule the maid service. We scheduled for the landscaping services. After emailing back and forth with one of the employees about what was included with the $50 a month fee we finally scheduled to have them come out to service our property. We were told that the $50 service included picking weeds, blowing out leaves, trimming of trees/bushes and cleaning up. Well Monday there landscaper came out and we walked him through the front and back showing him what needed to be done. Our backyard wasn't in bad condition at all mind you. Just had a handful of weeds, couple of bushes needed trimming an mainly just needed to blow out some leaves. Well he was here 45 mins, we noticed him start trimming some bushes so we thought perfect he's doing a good job. After he left we walked around and noticed he didn't trim bushes. Started one set of bushes then left some parts untrimmed and sticking out. Blew out half of the leaves. Didn't pick any of the weeds. He told me husband he was going to return with weed killer spray the next month. Left garage in bushes. I was very upset bc we not only gave him $50 but $10 for a tip. So $60 total and I felt like he didn't do anything. So we wrote an email to them just stating we weren't satisfied with the service. The lady replies back saying that we need to sign up for bi weekly service till our yard was perfect. We emailed back saying our home wasn't in horrible condition to begin with and that he just didn't finish. I then took photos and attached them showing her how our yards were left. I then just picked our weeds and cleaned up myself. Which defeats the whole purpose of why we hired someone. She finally emails back two days later saying oh we now see what your talking about. We will send him back out. We emailed back just saying we weren't interested in continuing service with their company. Terrible customer service and a waste of $60. Never again.",0

(1 hour body & 1/2 hour foot massage) We arrive at 8:32 and start filling out forms.  My wife's 1st question SPECIFICALLY asks for a strong therapist.  The receptionist says yes, there is a strong therapist.  My wife's 2nd question was if the therapist was Thai; the receptionist says no, they are Chinese...BUT they've been trained by a Thai therapist.  I have nothing against Chinese therapists (I am Chinese) when I am getting a Chinese massage.  The techniques are worlds apart.  The receptionist continues to say it's OK, many customers ask for these therapists, they are good, etc...\n\nSo we make the wrong choice and continue.\n\nWe change into their shirt and pants and lie down on the mat.  My massage starts with a foot rub and pressing on my legs.  Not much of a massage just kind of squeezing on my muscles.  Continued onto the rest of my legs.  After that she started to pull and bend my legs.  Not much pressure was being applied so I'm not sure what this \""exercise\"" was about.  Not much changed for the duration of the 1 hour.  A lot of of just lightly rubbing and petting like other Yelpers mentioned.  Rubbed my scalp, my ears, my back, my neck and my arms a few times.  Pulled on my fingers...THIS WAS NOT A MASSAGE.\nNow onto the last 1/2 hour, the foot massage.  The therapists actually switched at this point!  I didn't know what's going on until later.  Much of the same thing, squeezing my foot here and there and that's about it.\n\nMy wife is fuming about her massage while we're changing back to our clothes. \n\nFor her first hour, she had to tell the therapist where to massage and she needed to be stronger.  Nothing relaxing about this at all.  Kept telling her stronger, the therapist would press a little harder once or twice.  This one didn't have a clue of how or where to massage.  This went on for an hour.\nSo the therapists decide that they need to switch because the one massaging my wife was getting tired from using all her strength...WT??  My therapist had more energy because she was just squeezing my arms & legs, they switch so I get the tired therapist to massage my feet.  \nThe last 1/2 hour for my wife was exactly like mine, just a foot squeeze.\n\nSo we go to the front counter to tell the receptionist of what just happened.  She actually said to us, \""we came in too late in the day, all the therapists are tired.  It's time for them to go home.\""  If we knew this, we would not have even came here at all. I don't know why, but we paid and gave a tip...\n\nSo the next morning, I call and look for someone to talk to about my experience.  I called their other location and talked to a \""manager\"".  She took my number and said she'll call the \""general manager\"".\nI get a call and talk to this man and he said sorry I can't help you, you stayed for the 1.5 hours so I can't do anything for you.  I explained that what we received was not a massage and I shouldn't have to pay for this.\nHe said if the therapists used more strength, they can get in trouble if they hurt their customers.  I said they weren't even massaging their customers!  \nThis man is very impolite and did not care about customer service at all.  He hung up on me.\nOh yeah, he said we got a 20% new customer discount...we got a good price. Yeah right.\n\nPass on this place.

The ribs were the best of them all. The egg rolls were too greasy and had a very stale texture to it. Their sweet & sour sauce was tasteless and probably just gelatin and red food dye #4.

It's close by and I don't like Jacky Chan it's disgusting food so I would say I would order again if I was desprate and lazy to drive further to get something better. The soup was good, after I added chili to it. Overall, I wouldn't go out of my way to order from them. How can you mess up Chinese Food?

He seemed uninterested.   \n\nWe fell in love with the decor and all the fun items in the room.   I loved the fact that we had the spot to ourselves & the decor,  so I called my husband and his business partner to join us.  They met up with us and we tried the pizza.  \n\nWe had one that had chorizo and were blown away  by the flavor so we ordered another pizza.  As we were waiting on the food a camera crew showed up.  After a time of them setting up equipment they asked us if we would be willing to be on camera for Bar Rescue.  We agreed.  Thank goodness we were there or they wouldn't have had anyone to show on the shoot.\n\nA guy with blue hair showed up and was hanging behind the bar.  He was rude and leaning on the bar, watching what the crew was doing.  I asked him if he should clean up or mess of empty plates, dishes and napkins, and he said no he wasn't on the clock.  He laughed and moved to be closer in the background of the camera shot.  I got his attention again and said, \""Don't you take pride in your work?  The empty glasses and trash are in the shot.  Show me where the trash can is and I will clear it up.\""  After some reluctance he helped me clean up the mess.\n\nMy husband struck up a conversation with Jazz and found out he was one of the owners.  Later we found out that a guy who was watching us from the corner was the other owner.  When we left we said we would be back for the pizza.\n\nTwo weeks later my husband and I came in. Jazz was working and had no recollection of us.  How do you forget 5 locals who spent hours at your bar and eventually a camera crew making your place look good?  He didn't remember us so he barely talked with us, instead it was a Friday night and there was a group that came in that seemed to take his attention.  We got our pizza but refills on drinks came so slow that we were tired of waiting and decided to leave. \n\nOnce outside there was the group that had come in and Jazz.  A girl called out, \""Why are you leaving?  Stay the dancing is abut to go off.\""  We politely declined but were shocked at how again the place had such slow service and the owner seemed to be more interested in hanging out than making sure customers were happy.\n\nWe are gluttons for punishment I guess, because we had some friends in town and took them here for pizza.  They had seen the Bar Rescue show and wanted to try it.  We walked in and there were 6 people at the bar.  (6 on a Friday night happy hour time.)\n\nWe found a table and I walked up to the bar to order food and drinks.  Jazz was working again.  He was the only one behind the bar.  I ordered drinks and my friend got his food order out.  Jazz then turned his back to us and started making his way around the bar again.  Checking on people and chatting with them.  He came back after checking the bar for drinks.  He gave us our drinks and I said excuse me.  But some new people came in and sat at the bar and he was gone again.  My husband was on the phone and called out, \""Get me a Diet Coke please.\"" I said loudly in Jazz's direction, \""I'm trying but he hasn't gotten my order yet.\""\n\nAfter a while he came back and said, \""Did you need something.\"" I explained he hadn't gotten my drink and food order, only my friend's order had been completed.  He said, \""Okay well what do you want?\""  I ordered the chorizo pizza again to which he said, \""Oh I care about the safety of my customers.  There was an issue with food poisoning at Firefly.  Did you hear about that.\""  I nodded dumbfounded.\n\n\""Ever since that has happened I quit.  I have substituted it with sausage.  You will like it.\""  He said.  I wanted to call BS because the Firefly incident had happened in May or late April.  I had been to this spot twice in less than a month and they had it, but at this point why argue.  I was just happy to have my order taken.  I rolled my eyes a bit and noticed a zombie arm was gone on the wall from the decor.    Where it had been was a grey patch and holes where the nails had once been.  (Mind you this is a black background.)  How hard is it to get a ladder, slap some black paint on a spot, and make the focal point of your bar look somewhat okay?\n\nWe got our food but as before our drinks were empty.  When we asked the lady that delivered our food about our drinks she said, \""I think Jazz is working on that,\"" and disappeared back in the kitchen.  My husband tried to get drinks.  Jazz said he was busy and we would have to wait, as he had the hose in his hand. (We ordered waters and diet cokes.)  I give up this place has the worst service, music, and now what was good pizza is average. This place is a joke, don't go.",0

The dog is 10 years old while the cat is 2 years old.\n\nThe receptionists are very friendly and will greet you upon entering and they even have a greeter dog named Cheeto. Dr. Costa has been my primary Vet since obtaining both my animals. She has dealt with Rogue since she was a six week old kitten and Rogue is a very picky cat. She doesn't like most human beings outside of me and does not like being held outside of me either. Dr. Costa has such a genuine touch that she has been able to pick up Rogue and calm her down in order to trim her nails down. I've very happy to have the ability to have a Vet like that.\n\nRecently, our dog Dakota had a tumor coming out of her eye. Not only was Dr. Costa successful in getting rid of the tumor, but she also during time of operation cut off a skin growth, cleaned Dakotas teeth, and removed a bad tooth. She took amazingly good care of my elderly dog and also kept it at an amazing price.\n\nThis staff is this whole hospital is amazing---receptionists, vet techs, and vets alike.\n\nBTW, they also have a Pet-Portal Website which is able track and log your pets information.

448,0,"Poor design of hotel.  Rooms are small and you have to walk almost a mile it seems before getting to your room.  Crap!  We were here for Thanksgiving holiday and the service line for checking in was massive and it took at least 40 minutes before we were able to check in.  Customer service needs to move at rapid speed.  Our rep took some time to check us in at first telling us we were on the 3rd floor, then changed it again saying we were now on the 5th.  Annoying!  We also told her that we had two separate reservations and she indicated that she had taken care of everything for us.  However, she failed to tell us that our cards would be deactivated so late night we get back to our room only to find out we have to walk that long mile again back to the lobby to get our room keys activated again.  Annoyed!  \n\nThe rooms are some kinda funky.  Small sink and water deeps out of the shower, if you are not careful.  The only thing I liked about this place is that at least they paid me out a few hundred on the slots.  Would I stay again?  The answer is nope!",0

I didn't think anything of it (like I said sleep deprived) but my husband takes a spoonful and asks, \""what's this runny stuff?\"" I responded with \""caramel?\"" (Why would there be caramel in tiramisu??

The first haircut I received was acceptable, though I could barely tell that I had even gone for a trim.

I had emphasized that I prefer a blunt bob with minimal, blended layers, but the stylist just did what she wanted to do I guess.

454,0,"This is the best Thai food I have had from their eggplant dish to their pad thai noodle dishes to the soups and the many other dishes I have tried there. I always keep coming back not only for the food but the great service. \n\nThe pricing is pretty standard, $8-9 for a dish but they are large portions so definitely worth it.\n\nThe only negative is the lack of choice for dessert. They only have coconut ice cream (which is really good) and coconut custard. \n\nThe place is usually not crowded so you're immediately seated with no wait time (I've been there for both lunch and dinner). \n\nThe bathrooms are okay, they need a bit of updating but are clean. \n\nI gave it a 5 star mainly for the food and service, things like the dessert menu and the bathrooms can be easily \""remodeled\"".",4

It's a beautiful hotel from the outside, but I think It is just old now, and service didn't help.

I called and they said just come down to the \""manager's desk\"" and they will get us a new room, so we hiked down and not one person was willing to help us.  When we finally got to someone, she rudely said go to the desk at the very end.  We did, and no one was there.  Waited 10 minuted before going to here again, and she was just annoyed at this point with me.  She told me to wait there and someone would help me.  So I did, and about  10 minutes later, someone stumbled down to us and told us to go the the OTHER SIDE!  If you have been here, it is a long desk!  Especially when you have 2 full bottles in your bag, ha ha.  \nOverall, just a bad customer service experience, maybe if we were there 1 hour prior, it would've just been an old hotel and not so horrible.

460,0,"This place is okay. I wasn't blown away by the food, the atmosphere, or the service. \n\nMy husband and I visited this restaurant during an anniversary weekend in Vegas. We drove by this place and thought it looked interesting. Since we love good food and that's hard to find on the trendy, overpriced Strip, we decided to venture beyond it for our anniversary dinner. \n\nI was really excited to eat here and was pretty happy with my food until the entrees arrived. We both ordered the Prix Fare ($38 each) and the crudite, olives, bread, and appetizers were decadent. I am not an expert on French cuisine but it tasted fabulous to me. The entree was mediocre and not a strong point, so possibly the Prix Fare menu is not the best choice. I would have to order from the specials in order to make my final conclusion. \n\nI would've given this place another star (or two) despite the average food if it wasn't for the wait staff. Unfortunately, our server (the only waiter) was chatty (to an extreme), slow, forgetful, and downright frightening. My husband found him entertaining (to be polite), but I feel like he ruined our experience. I don't want to write too many negative comments about this poor man, as most people find him humorous and engaging based on the reviews. You will have to witness his behavior for yourself. \n\nI don't think I'll go back. The total was $105 plus tip. Not an outrageous amount for a special occasion, but far too much for a mediocre evening.",2
461,0,"First off, I feel bad giving this place just three stars. After reading all the reviews, I was really hoping to like it a lot more than I did. I've heard for months from friends and fellow yelpers about how awesome this place is, so we decided to give it a try for early Vday dinner. \n\nThe atmosphere is very very nice. Nice little cottage with a kitchen (where they have a few tables next to the chef), a dining area, and an outside patio area. There are lots of candles and can be romantic place. The waiters were all nice, but we had some issues with the service. A group of 4 that came 20mins later than us(just 2) sat next to our table and kept getting food quicker than us. The most annoying part was that the waiters kept telling us our food would come, but the speed and service was definitely lacking. \n\nAs for the food, it was definitely worth 3+ stars except for the main chicken pesto dish. It was just two butterflied chicken pieces with pesto sauce, no vegetables, no special sauce, nothing special. I did love the appetizer 1 (white bean soup with side of bread with asiago cheese), appetizer 2 (barley and poached shrimp w/ sweet asian chili sauce), and one of the main dishes (pork tenderloin with a sweet chutney/hint of curry sauce and asparagus). The dessert was just some strawberries and fudge brownie. Again, nothing special.\n\nAll in all, I did like the experience, but the food left me thinking there could have been more or that it could have been better. Maybe I went in thinking too highly of this place. I am willing to give it another try, but it's not #1 that I would recommend to a friend.\n\n** I wanted to add something. Chris, the owner of the restaurant sent me an apology via email and phone call. This says a lot considering chefs will get very offended if you talk remotely bad about their food/creations. I have to admit. I feel bad if I seem very cruel in my review, but I feel that I was not over-exaggerating anything. I like to think that I speak the truth and hopefully readers can appreciate that. One last thing.. Chris pointed out to me that the chicken pesto had provolone cheese and spinach. I am sorry Chris, I have a dull palate. \n\nAgain, i would like to try cafe monarch again and will update on my next visit!",2

Of course nothing goes better with tacos than diet coke.  Megan's tacos were great, and mine were good too.  Wasn't real fond of the sweet pineapple salsa on the pork, but I just dug that off after the first bite and poured on the salsa.  The reason for the 3 stars you ask?  Parking absolutely sucks.  I mean it took us as long to park as it did to eat our tacos.  And then of course you have to pay to park, which sucks some more.  Just for that reason, I wouldn't go back.

467,0,"*** Review is for casino only ***\n\nThe Stratosphere casino is a fairly large area that meanders from the self park garage around to Las Vegas Boulevard.  There are little tricks to remember where you want to go and which set of stairs/escalators are the best for getting to the theatre.\n\nThe casino itself has a good selection of various slots and denominations.  They seem to target the lower rollers like me.  The casino seems to be a lot cleaner than it was when I've been there in the past.  The cocktail waitresses were around often last night and were very pleasant women.  I did notice the large percent of people who were smoking but unless you were right near them, smoke was not a problem.  They've installed a good ventilation system.\n\nI'll always have fond thoughts about the Strat even though I'm not there very often.

My boyfriend was starving so he ordered what he THOUGHT was a steak, only to be presented with four chunks of beef on two sticks, and some grilled vegetables.  The chicken fettucini had maybe three small pieces of chicken in it, which was disappointing.

Tin Tin has a wide variety of chinese dishes, steamed crab legs and oysters, lots of shrimp, a sushi buffet, and the classic kiddy table with some french fries and mac and cheese, and an ice cream machine - which scores BIG points with me.

474,0,"My wife and I had the exact experiences as everyone else and we are kicking ourselves for not reading these reviews before we adopted!\n\nLike everyone else when we first applied to adopt, Moondoggies could not be quicker in responding to us and setting up a meeting. We came all the way up from San Diego because we had been searching for a Great Dane puppy to adopt. The lady we met was very nice and seemed totally legit. She said we looked like good people and if we wanted we could adopt the dog on the spot. She also said that the adoption included having the dog spayed and chipped. She even offered us a great deal on getting the dog stomach stapled.\n\nHow could we say no?\n\nWe signed the contract and the check and we were told that they would be calling us to make sure we got the vaccinations done and to schedule an appointment for the spay and chipping.\n\nAnd like everyone else here... We never heard from them again. We have called the lady we talked to, we called the number on the sight, we wrote emails, and even tried to reach them on Facebook. For awhile I really thought that they were just busy and felt bad for them because they are run by volunteers.\n\nBut what made me realize that they were a scam was when I posed as a person who was interested in adoption and was put right through to someone. Her tone immediately changed when I told them that we were looking to get our dog spayed and chipped. She was very short with me and said that she was away from the office and would have to look at our file. Then she would call us back. She didn't.\n\nUpdate Feb 16---\nMoondoggies contacted us after I posted this review and finally offered to have our dog spayed and chipped. However after not hearing for them for months we have already had our dog spayed and chipped. I was glad to finally hear from them but it was sad that I had to right a bad review in order to for them to finally contact me. I truly hope that they are a real rescue place and not a puppy mill or a scam. I hope that they make some serious changes in the way they do business!",0

The Bakery Cafe is a place I've been to a few times and had reasonable success with, though I tend to prefer Spotted Donkey upstairs. \n\nOn my last visit, however, I walked out in disgust.  After looking over their elaborate-sounding Sandwich menu, I had a sudden desire for a specific, basic sandwich, and asked for it. I was told I had to order from the menu. Why? the restaurant was almost empty, and my sandwich request was as simple as it comes (BLT) in terms of ingredients (I saw they had bacon in their sandwiches). I didn't care how much they charged me for it - they could have said $10 and I would have been fine with that.  We ended up going upstairs to Spotted Donkey and dropping $50 for a lunch instead - business they could have had.

I just don't get it, especially in a place struggling to survive.",0

Not that chaotic and grubby are huge minuses in my opinion.  SF Supermarket has more Vietnamese items than Diho or 99 Ranch.

Most of the produce is pretty shabby, I get the feeling that this is the place other Von's stores dump their about to expire goods.  Their prices also suck.  I suspect that's because this is probably the closest grocery store to the strip.  The booze and ice in particular are no bargin.\n\nAnd of course you have all the crack heads and freaks hasseling you in the parking lot, that's always a treat!\n\nSteer Clear Big Tuna, head for open waters!

They did have a decent selection of breakfast/brunch food, mediocre sushi bar/asian section, salad and small bites, and pretty good dessert spread (but honestly... it's DESSERT). I've gone to the Wynn and Bellagio buffets, both which outshine this one.\n\nThey had unique pancakes, such as the red velvet and guinness pancakes, but otherwise lacked anything too noteworthy. I will say though that I enjoyed their small pans/platters of dishes, such as the guyere stuffed gnocchi and other tasty pastas. i woud have liked to see a bigger sushi spread though. \n\nOverall, it was good and definitely made me walk out full and satisfied, but compared to the other buffet options in Vegas, this wouldn't be my first pick.",0

Stuffed characters, banks, name straps, clothing, and even the actual M&M's race car on the 4th floor, and yes you are not seeing things, there are 4 floors of everything M&M's.

But we both really enjoyed our meals. There was a 45 minute wait for a table, but we quickly snagged a table in the bar area, which wasn't too loud or busy. I had a really delicious malbec and we both had soup as appetizers - lobster bisque and cream of mushroom. They were both delicious, and after eating the soup and the warm bread and flaxseed crisps they give out free, I knew we were probably in for a good meal. When our entrees came, we weren't disappointed. My friend had a scallop and shrimp eggplant spicy risotto (ok, that's not what it was called, but that's what it was) which was great and I had a ricotta-filled ravioli with vodka sauce - it's supposed to come with prosciutto, but they were nice about subbing mushrooms for me instead, since I'm a vegetarian.

But when I spend money for a good night of sleep, I want to enjoy my sleep and not worry.\nPerhaps I stayed at the 5 stars hotel more then the regular 3 stars one in Vegas, but even a nice motel is better then staying here.\n\n2 1/2 stars for the room itself. Minus 1/2 stars for the disgusting, dirty parking structure and it's hallway to the casino. It's filthy and smelly. The Valet parking is totally on the other side of the building away from the casino and the hotel lobby! Kind of a long walk if you're carrying all those luggage.\n\nI hate jumping from hotel to hotel, but since we wanted to extend our stay in Vegas and wanted a more convenient location on the strip, we searched the Internet and thought we got this great deal for a newly remodeled room.\n\nTHE ROOMS: \nIt's like taking a 1980's hotel room and \""renovating\"" it by cover ups. The rooms are repainted and floors were redone, and new beds. That's only the best part.\nThey have new vinyl wooden floor, no carpet except a small rug in the walk way. (Which is a good things so it doesn't stink from the 30 year old carpet.. lol)\nThe furniture as of the table, night light table, and TV stand are all kind of banged up and so ready for a face lift!\n\nThe room itself is OK., but the tiny bathroom is where I draw the line. The door hinges and side panels were all old and rusty. They're mildew stain on the corners and white tiles inside the bath tub. It's clean but it's old and it's falling apart. The bathroom floor tiles were black and dingy, guess when they replaced the room's floor, they couldn't budget another 60 square feet of flooring in for bathroom, instead they rather gross out their guests.  They have nearly to none amenities. No slippers, not even coffee maker. Even the Motel 8 down the street has a coffee maker. They have an old wall burnt out hair dryer. I wouldn't risk it, because it looks like it's ready electrocute you when you turn it on.\n\nIf they did a remodeled, why didn't they just rip everything apart and replace it back with a everything new, this way, it really looks like they took the easy way out. Cover the stain up but not cleaning it out!! Although it may not be that bad, but thought of it, is kind of disgusting. There is no fan blower in the small tiny bathroom. So if any one have to go #2, make sure you buy a room spray for the bathroom. Without the bathroom fan, even when I take a shower, I have to leave the door with an open airway, or else I would suffocate in the hot steam.\n\nThe air conditioning is hell LOUD! If you're a light sleeper, make sure it's off! \nWe were in room 7084 and 7086 with a connecting door with old rusted door knob and chain. We had a great view of the strip right in front of the Caesar Palace fountain... It would have been so much prettier if the windows were clean. It was so disgusting and barely can see through the windows for the view.\n\nWould I stay here again?.. probably not unless I was desperate.. The parking structure and valet is very inconvenience. It's only idealistic to stay here if you go out walking from casino to casino. But we don't. We just drive around and when we get back to the Flamingo, we just stay at the hotel/ casino.",0

526,0,"I preface by saying: we wanted to like this place. We can bike to it, it's family-friendly and did i mention that it's close? It is busy even before 6pm. Parking is only achieved through luck or valet. Kudos to word getting out about Arcadia Tavern. But...\n\nREVIEW\nUninspired bar food in a clean, open, friendly atmosphere. Lack of imagination is clear in the tired sports grill theme - aging fratboy paradise. Might as well be a chain. Then the execution might be tighter. The pizza was basically Freschetta ultra-thin crust, made to order. Almost looked like the pizza in the Nutrisystem commercials - undercooked and topped with processed items.\n\nFish n' Chips usually deserve their own paragraph. These get 2 paragraphs, but for the wrong reasons:\n\nFish n' chips batter should be bound to the fish at the molecular level. Attempting to peel the crust off should result in tearing away fish flesh, or revealing fish that is crispy around the edge with the bound batter unwilling to separate. Fish n' Chips don't bend! Cook hot, cook fast, cook through. You can easily achieve this at home with a Waring fryer. A decent batter and a properly used commercial fryer should be a slam-dunk. \n\nAnatomy of an unacceptable fish n' chip: hunk of barely cooked through whitefish, surrounded by a loose layer of mushy batter than is not bound to the fish at all, with a fried-looking but barely crisp outer edge. I removed the end of the fish stick and shook it and the lump of fish fell out of the sad greasy tube. No discernible flavor unless dunked in the accompanying restaurant supply grade tartar slop. \n\nTots? A moment of inspiration? Sadly no. The key to a tot is that it's made up of little distinct chunks of potato. Like a tiny hash brown capsule. You should be able to break them open and pull apart the pieces. Fast food can even pull this off - the Taco John Potato Ol\u00e9 for example. These were more like greasy, fried mash potatoes. And salty. I'm not drunk enough for this.\n\nI want to give it 3 stars for being clean, having decent service and having no less than 20 plasma displays. But 3 is A-okay. I think there might be something A-okay there, but we haven't found it yet. We will return to try the sliders just to see if there is a dependable fallback dish for those nights when we just don't feel like cooking and want somewhere close. In the meantime, if the owners (investors, more like) care to be more than just the next thing to FAILBOAT in that space, they need to get back to the food. Once the buzz fades, the food will not bring people back. Go to Four Peaks Tempe. Go to Matt's Big B. Go to George n' Dragon. Go to Lo Lo's for chrissake. Go see how simple food can still be good food, and not scream \""short-term, dabbling in the industry business model\"".\n\nWill update after another visit. Maybe.",0

Tried the Buddy's Salumi & Cheese Board (olives, pickled vegetables, grilled Italian bread, genoa salami, spicy capicola, proscuitto di parma, grana padano, tuscan pecorino, and gorgonzola).  The capicola and proscuitto were the best I've ever had and the gorgonzola was epic - bleu cheese flavor with the texture of brie.  Cheeseburger at an Italian restaurant?  You bet because the Pat Lafrieda Burger (brioche bun, tomato aioli, provolone cheese, tuscan fries) was really tasty.

And don't get me started on how bomb diggity I was at The Lion King.  You could only wish you had my skillz.\n\nWell the video game days are behind me now but I live vicariously through my husband.  I watch him play a few times a week and he graciously plays Lego games with me so I can feel like I'm still in the gamer loop.  If gamers played Lego games, that is.\n\nWhen I first heard about Insert Coin(s) I knew that I had to get my husband down there.  Beer AND video games?  He would love me forever.  So I was stoked when I had the chance to be at a Yelp event there this past summer.  The place was pretty amazing and we just finally got the opportunity to come back this past week.\n\nOk, so I'm confused on how to rate the place.  It's catering to the nerdy crowd and the owner is a Pac Man master.... But there are tables with bottle service like you'd find at a club on the Strip.  There are tons of screens to play video games at the bar for free (Mortal Combat and Vodka Cranberry, anyone?).... But the drink prices nearly rival the bars on the Strip.  Seven bucks for a Budweiser on a Thursday?\n\nCons: Drink prices and appears to cater to a hipper, cooler (read: not into video games) clientele on the weekends.\n\nPros: Friendly bartenders, free video games, lots of arcade games, cool atmosphere, and a mellow crowd during the week.\n\nIn the end I'm going with 4-stars.  Insert Coin(s) has done a lot for downtown and I really appreciate that.  Plus they gave me a few free drinks at a Rugby Sevens event last week.  I think that helped make up for the $7 Budweiser fiasco.\n\nIf you're a nerd like me, hit the place up during the week.  If you're a cool kid, then get there on the weekend.",2

The girl behind the counter prepped it and put on the grill and when the time was up to pull it off, the tortilla got stuck, I could already see it was partially well done and falling apart, she really had to scrape to get it off the grill. My advise: PAM cooking spray. \nI thought she was going to suggest to remake or offer a discount. I paid for my meal and sat down to eat. It was so soggy I could not pick it up, I had to use a fork. I can understand that maybe the pork was so juicy thus creating the well done soggy tortilla. The pork was good, but the tortilla part was so mushy and then the cheese just globbed. I pretty much just picked the pork. The guacamole was good. \nI would suggest maybe for the pulled pork entrees, drain the juice, otherwise you just end up with a soggy mess. \n\nNot the worst I have had and not the best.

Of course, the pond and the ducks are great, but it produces demanding birds that the net over the pond can't completely prevent.

The food was memorable, only in that it was such a bore. I got a quesadilla and could have gotten something more interesting/tastier at Denny's. In fact, I was really astounded at the boringness of the food. Everyone I was with at the table said that they thought the meal was lacking in a way.\n\nThis visit took place in mid-May 2010, and I'm not sure if they had just gotten a new cook, or had some other issue.

When I got home and took a closer look at my highlights, they were yellow. I asked if he used a toner and he said no. He didn't offer to tone my hair or fix the color.

He told me to come back and he would fix them, which he did but in a matter weeks all my extensions fell out! So AGAIN I had to go to another salon to redo/fix my highlights and extensions. I asked Eli for a refund due to the poor job he did and the lack of effort in which he tried to fix my hair! I bought my own extensions which cost $400.  He charged me $400 but only offered to refund me $100! I had to threaten to take him to small claims court for him to only refund me $150. This was months later so I just took the $150.

I had to remind her to give me bangs, which she cut in a straight line rather than in a slant for side-swept bangs. She spent all of ten minutes on my hair before rushing me to the register. She hardly gave me time to explain what I wanted or look at the layering in my hair, and the way that she dried what little water she put in my hair made it difficult to see what the cut looked like. \n\nWhen I got home I ended up having to trim my bangs into the correct shape, as well as having to trim portions of the hair which were inches wide to the same length as the rest of my hair. One chunk of hair, right in the front, was THREE inches longer than the rest of my hair upon being straightened. \n\nAdditionally, when walking in I inquired about the price of a cut and was assured that it would cost $7 (as the window display showed) but then was charged $12 for a haircut that was not at all what I asked for. \n\nI will NOT be coming back and I will be advising as many people as I can that this is NOT a place to go for a real hair cut if you want a new style.",0

No 'hello' or 'welcome' or 'what can I get you'.  Just a blank stare.  I ordered an Everything Bagel, toasted with cream cheese and a medium coffee.  Basic right?  I get a continued blank stare.  This goes on for an uncomfortably long time, like 15 seconds.  Not a word is uttered.  Finally I say, \""What?  What's the problem?  Why are you staring at me?\""  What I then find out through series of gestures, grunts and finally another employee, is that the gentleman they decided would work the front register speaks no English.  Not even enough to understand 'donuts' or 'bagel'.  After several minutes of pantomime, I figure out we need someone else to assist.  That takes about 2 minutes to get.  Guess what, another language barrier, but involving a totally different region of the world.  Who would have thought?  I finally flag down a manager.  By this time the people behind me in line are restless.  I get my order put in with the help of three other employees.  They get it wrong.

The atmosphere is nice, and we probably just went at an off time, yet, we went during off lunch hours, so the service should have been better.\nOur server greeted our table, took our drink order, took our food order, and was not to be seen again... well, we saw her waiting the other tables but purposely avoiding ours.  That continued for 35 minutes while other tables with larger groups who were seated after us were served before us... 35 minutes for three bowls of soup, a garden salad (which never came) and a couple pieces of fried fish?  I think not.  We flagged down a manager who said he was finishing it right up.  And then when the food came out, it was cold.  We mentioned it to her and she seemed frustrated that she needed to make another trip to the line to have it reheated.  Give me a break. \nI also ordered a chicken quesadilla.  On the menu it stated \""stuffed with pico.  Served with (some sort of ) sour cream\"".  It came out and was *SURPRISE* drizzled with some sort of chipotle and cilantro mayonnaise-based topping.  Maybe its because I live in the land of full disclosure, I'm not sure, but I was expecting tortilla, chicken, cheese, pico and sour cream on the side, not to have some calorie-laden ranch-dressing-derivative covering the tortilla.\nSo for the last ten minutes of our meal (and the first five) the service was very attentive.  If you like that, eat here.  If you like having service at a restaurant, and warm seafood, go to Red Lobster instead.\nOn the way out, I saw a TON of food under heat lamps on their line, and some of it coming out of steamtables... absolutely NO excuse for cold, cream-based soup... and no excuse for that small of an order taking 35 minutes.\nI usually give places two shots, just in case they were having an off day.

This is the first time I have actually been inside. I heard that it has recently been redone, so I cannot compare it to prior, but I thought the place looked rather inviting. Unfortunately, the food is just not that good. We had the calamari fritti, which I consider a safe choice. They did not taste bad - they tasted like nothing at all. I tried putting lemon on them, then marinara sauce, then salt. Finally I dipped them in olive oil. Each time it made them more memorable, but not more edible. We also tried the pizza (both the Italian meat pizza and the pesto chicken one). If I had bought a frozen pizza at the store and it tasted like that fresh out of the oven I would have thought of it as pretty good pizza and probably bought it again. However, I expect more of an Italian restaurant, especially considering how long it took to prepare (and there was only one other couple in the entire place). \nOverall, I am just disappointed.

We then had to fill out a waiver and each adult had to pay a tip to them of $5.00. They only had one hay ride truck for the over 100 people there! we had to wait outside in the hot sun for over an hour for the 1st peoples hay ride to finish. After the hay ride my kids and were supposed to then go to the Easter egg hunt. While getting off the hay ride, we witnessed the ranch worker dumping empty plastic eggs all the ground. We cam there for the candy and my kids were really let down. This was disappointing as it seemed like it would be a great family day if they got their act together.",0
562,0,"Cornerstone is what one may call a \""Mega Church\"" and it is mega-sized for sure.  But the interesting thing I have found is that the size of the church actually enables it to be whatever you want it to be.  Sure, you could come to Sunday services every week for a year and never see the same person twice, but if you are looking for a deeper community, there is literally something for everyone.  Be it a class, small church, support group, or other gathering, you can find whatever is right for you for your place in life.  Or if it's the anonymity of a large church you're looking for, that's definitely possible... with smiling faces all around and a really great energy.\n\nCornerstone offers a coffee shop/cafe area, bookstore, a ton of volunteer opportunities, men's ministries, women's ministries, retreats, mission trips, top-tier worship leaders, sermons that dig in to the bible and provide real-life context, and thoughtful kids programs.\n\nYou can feel confident dropping your children off while you're at the service, because they will be cared for by background-checked, well-trained individuals ready to teach your kid the week's bible lesson!  Babies mere weeks old are welcome, and the older kids have fun activities every week.\n\nCheck out a service to see what it's all about, and stop by the information booths for further direction!",4

578,0,"When in Vegas, you have to know your way around. I like to think that I'm pretty knowledgeable about the club scene. Well, my girlfriends and I happen to be in Vegas on a Wednesday so we decided to hit up Eclipse. Since discovering Surrender's nighttime pool club, we've been a fan of that scene since. We got a $500 comped table from a host, Kwame, who was awesome btw! He got us checked in and everything ran smoothly. \n\nWelp, that's where it ended. Our waitress, Kelly, was awful. Awful awful lady! She didn't seem to want us there. She over poured our drinks, which I assume to get us to buy a new bottle quicker. My group of girls are all pretty petite, I think you can assume that our tolerance isn't that high. She made us 6 drinks, and the entire bottle was almost finished. You can only assume that those were some stiff drinks! Then when we found out we got charged for 8 water bottles, totaling to over $50 we were super annoyed with the fact that she was annoyed with us. She tells me, \""You said you wanted water.\"" I kindly replied, \""Yes, I did want water, as a mixer for my vodka waters, but I did request 8 bottles.\"" Especially at such a high price! I'm not that frugal but her attitude stunk! She made me feel cheap. Look lady, your 22% gratuity may already be included, but you can at least try to act like you're working for your money! After that, she took our whole bottle service away, just as quickly as we finished our last drop of vodka. RUDE! I've never felt so rushed and embarrassed. And the shitty thing is that her tip for her hour and a half of waiting on us, which was very minimal might I add, was over $130. \n\nEclipse, itself is okay. Big ordinary pool in the center so you can walk around the entire perimeter. DJ set up is at one end of the pool and the bar was opposite of that. It wasn't too visually appealing though.

Now it's just a dated store with an annoying elevator. The ambiance is cold, starting with the cheesy fruit pictures outside. Dated and sad. This neighborhood needs a grocery store with local,organic produce, natural cleaning products like Method, and meat/seafood from small companies that take special care with the animals and the earth. Maybe the wine bar has potential in nice weather...outdoor tables...overlooking The Intersection of Many Crashes. But it might be nice out there. Wine, with small plates?

589,0,"My husband and I usually come in on Tuesdays for the .35 wing special. The service is always bad but we usually overlook it as there are few places to eat in San Tan Valley and we kind of like the wings.  Tonight's experience especially unsatisfactory.   Disappointment all around.  Still not sure on who was supposed to be our actual waitress.  We waited a very unreasonable amount of time to get our drinks and have our order taken.  We finally got our beer from a gal but she said she can't take our order for food and we asked her to send over someone who can.  In fact, after waiting over 20 minutes after putting in our drink order, and still not having someone take our order, we had to pull a waitress from the other dining room to take our order and she was kind enough to do so.  She was already busy and seemed to be the only one actually being productive.   A short blonde waitress finally brought our wings finally after more than a half hour but didn't even give us time to ask for napkins and plates before running off only to spend about 10 minutes with who appeared to be her boyfriend and some friends a couple booths over.  We watched this short blonde waitress carry on with her boyfriend and she seemed to have a very foul attitude.  We assumed she was the \""intended\"" waitress for our table but evidentley not because a 4th waitress came to our table to check on us and she said she was our waitress apologetically because we were just finally meeting at the end of our meal.  We waited another unreasonabe amount of time for the check and a couple boxes for the leftover wings.  She finally came back with the check and a tiny box and said that was all she was allowed to give us for the dozen or so left over wings.  This box only held a few wings and we had 2 different flavors.  I told her how getting and adequate to go box has never been a problem in the past and insisted on speaking to the manager.  The manager \""Brooke\"" came to the table and I asked for an adequate box for our leftover wings and she said it's the rules not to give any more than the 1 tiny styrofoam box.  I could tell she wasn't the usual manager because she was dead set on passing the buck to the normal manager saying how they are even stricter with the rules than she is.  After I told her we are Tuesday regulars and she is clearly new to Tuesdays and lecturing her on how a good manager would handle things correctly without passing the buck and making the regular customer feel unimportant , she agreed to give us another tiny box.  But ONLY this time.  She really had no concern for the complaint about the bad service and in fact dismissed our concerns.  Tonight's experience was 100% a result of terrible management and may cost this restraunt a couple of good once a week regular patrons.  So if you happen to visit this place on a Tuesday and you have the misfortune of having the fill in Manager named Brooke, expect a similar experience and make sure you eat every wing your served at the table because they are too cheap to give an adequate to go box for the leftovers and they would rather the food just go to waste.",0
590,0,"Pretty good spot, but I've had better. Special menu rolls were really good. Other rolls not as inspired. My chief complaint here is the sushi rice, which is closest to the dreaded Costco or supermarket style of sushi rice: bland and mushy. Sushi rice should be fresh and have a slight tang from a little sugar and rice wine vinegar. You should not be able to smear it on the roof of your mouth with your tongue. \n\nYou could do a lot worse though. Service was fine, but strained due to severe language or accent barrier. Hey, we had a good time and we left full and happy, so there you go. Yeah, we'd go back. \n\nSapporo roll, my boyfriend, and vampire all were hits.",3

We told our waitress that we just wanted some light appetizers and some drinks as we were catching a movie next door.  She seemed upset or frustrated that we were not ordering a full dinner.  We each got our drinks pretty quick - but after an hour, our two appetizers still hadn't arrived.  While sitting for that long I did find the Groupon deal and bought it while I was sitting there.\n\nNow we were up against the clock and we couldn't wait any longer.  I told my family to go check into the movie and I would let them know we're going to leave.  After 15 minutes, I still couldn't find my waitress. (The place isn't that big and there must have been a half a dozen food servers in a small and moderately busy restaurant ). FINALLY  she came out - with my food packaged to go. When I told her this was ridiculous - she snapped back at me and said they were busy in the kitchen.  Now I have $50 check and I get to go put it in my car for a few hours.  \n\nI asked to see the manager and suddenly her English was not all that great.  I tried to show her my Groupon deal and she just walked away with my credit card and the check - with an attitude.\n\nIf I wasn't late and my family already sitting in the theater I would have complained further.  So I was late for my show, the food simply went in a trash can and dinner consisted of one drink and some bread drenched in butter.  So now I am stuck with this groupon because I am not sure i really want to go back.  Maybe the manager will try to make it right.\n\nI gave two stars simply because of mediocre visits in the past.

616,0,Best steakhouse in Vegas. My wife and I come here almost everytime we are in Vegas and it is always amazing. We have tried all of the other top steakhouses on the strip but this place is much better with out the over doneness of the casinos and they dont rip you off. \nSteaks are always cook perfectly and their sides are great.,3

619,0,"Blehhhh :/ this place shouldn't even be in business with how many decent sushi restaurants there are around town. Just don't even bother.\n\nFood is definitely subpar. Tiny tiny tiny pieces of fish on their nigiri, sushi rolls falling apart, hardly any roll options that weren't filled with \""freshened up\"" not so good fish drenched in spicy sauce. I really didn't have a single item that tasted fresh or at all interesting. Bad food quality and boring options.  How did I even get talked into going here???\n\nAwful service - no water refills, not enough chopsticks, no soy sauce bowls, one plate of wasabi and ginger for 6 people (gross if people want seconds), forgetting orders left and right, no napkins, crazy long waits for things that required no prep (like ice cream), and on top of all that an auto gratuity for seriously horrible service. Auto gratuity for a party of six is really pushing it in my opinion. That's a relatively normal sized group. Not to mention our server was rude and silently glared if we asked for anything at all, and wouldn't even look in our direction for most of the night, probably because he knew he wouldn't have to actually give decent service to make his tip. Seriously annoyed I had to autotip that guy so much (and I live on tips myself, so it's definitely bad if even I don't want to give him my money.) \n\nObviously never ever going back.",0

Tiny tables without room to get between them without dragging your shirt and rear end on the next guys table.  \n\nMy friend had a cocktail that tasted like dish soap.  My wine was suggested by the waiter, apparently the restaurant sommelier had graduated from the \""Walmart school of real good wines\"".

647,0,"Just want to say off the bat that in no way am I affiliated with Shane Co or getting kickbacks from them. Just writing an honest review on my experience there recently.\n\n1) Overall/ Intro\n2) Sales reps\n3) Selection process\n4) Price negotiation\n5) Conclusion\n\n1) The staff was very comforting and professional. I've never been shopping for engagement rings before and the people there made it great. I knew exactly what I wanted going in, my girlfriend had sent me a bunch of creations off their website (which is an awesome resource) and I picked out the few that I liked.  It certainly helps to know the color differences (D, E, F, etc.), cuts (cushion, princess, emerald...) and clarity( VVSI, VSI, IF, etc.) before going in. That's just my personal preference. Whenever I'm buying something that's costing me twice as much as I paid for my car (which is a good ol reliable civic), I like to do my homework. But the staff is very knowledgeable about EVERYTHING jewelry. The big pluses of Shane Co for me personally include:\n-lifetime guarantee on products: pretty much fix anything you buy from them, for life. Except if it gets lost or stolen\n-60 day refund or exchange after purchase\n-6 month interest free loan to pay off whatever you buy. amount depends on cred score.\n\n2) These guys have to be trained on being low pressure. Because they let you browse around however long you want. And I must have been asked by 3 employees how I was going to propose to my gf.\n\n3) First we picked out a setting, then we went to stone. They run you through spiels about where diamonds come from, even bring out 3 mystery stone related to what you're looking for and let you guess the 4 C's. Kinda of fun. Let's you see what's important to you. After I picked out the stone, that was it. I made a down payment before leaving, got my cool IGI certificate for the diamond and then picked up the ring 2 days later.\n\n4)A big question I had before going in that I couldn't find the answer to on the internet was\""Can you negotiate prices?\"" And the answer is YES. The Shane Co rep gave this away when she asked me after I first walked in \""What out-the-door price were you looking at today?\"" After she wrote the amounts for the stone, setting, and tax on a little notepad I made an offer below the price. She walked away and got it cleared by her boss. I only bid about 5% off the price and was kind of wishing I had bid lower. But bottom line: Don't pay the tag price! \n\n5) Overall, I'm pleased with my purchase and comforted by the fact that if something were to happen to the ring I can always take it into any Shane Co location and know it's getting quality repairs for FREE.",2

Chicken and a cilantro sauce along with the nacho cheese and jalape\u00f1os. There was a pretty good sized portion and I took some in a box with me for later. I never did end up feeling sick so I think the nachos are a safe bet here.\n\nOther notes, I did hear another customer complain of dirty silverware, mine was ok.

They were out of drink cup covers so I asked for some and the kid brings them out and takes his bare hands and grabs out two of them. I would have rather he have gloves and place them in the holder so I can grab my own without his touching them or at least would dig down into the center to avoid the ones he did touch.\n\nHowever, the pizza wasn't good.

The guy has lots of great stories and provides some interesting details about the wines.  Each session is about a different wine region and/or type of wine and is about an hour.  It costs just a few bucks and you get 5-6 good size pours along with some cheese and prosciutto.  It really is a great value and a pretty good time.

Which means I go for the middle of the heat level. This level, for me, was ALMOST perfect. Next time I'll probably go for a 4. But that's just me.\n\nOh and by the way I got the chicken wings too. OH MAH GOD. How good were they? Not greasy. Perfectly cooked. Not too small, not too big. Oh and the sauce? PERFECT!\n\nGet your butt to Le Thai pronto.",4

The main student nights are Thursday and Friday, so avoid them if you don't want to be asked for a cigarette and what daddy does.\n\nI came here on a Saturday with my mum (HI MUM!) and my brothers after my brothers 21st dinner. There were about 15 of us, so we got priority entry and a table in a sectioned off area. Hey, we were pretty special.

682,0,"We had lunch yesterday and I'm giving the 2 stars because yes, of course I've experienced better but will say they deserve 2 stars because of how apologetic they were about our lunch. First of we arrived right at 1 pm and there were only 3 tables in the restaurant but after being seated we waited 5 full minutes and had to ask for menus and water (5 servers were standing around the computer chatting). WOW. We waited 40 minutes for our food and after all that my husbands burger was well done not medium rare and my dish came out afterwards which they apologized for profusely.  The tomato soup was outstanding but the burger and my meatballs were mediocre at best.  The kitchen and service needs a lot of work.  I'm not real interested in the chef although I'm sure he is very talented but I would say I personally think his time might be better spent in the kitchen instead of visiting with customers at this early point in his restaurant launch.  The G.M. Linda was very friendly and asked us to please return so we may at some point but first impressions really are everything. If they had been busy, I would have understand but asking for menus and service? We were regulars at Petra's so were hoping for a good replacement restaurant where we could become regulars.

Bad idea, I guess. \n\nLong story short, we wanted to eat lightly and ordered a few vegetable rolls.They weren't on the menu (they used to be, at $4 a roll) so I spoke with the sushi chef (not one of the usuals I see there) and asked him to be creative in whipping something up for us. We were served three boring, small (4 pieces including ends) rolls that were severely lacking in creativity or excitement. \n\nBill comes and we're charged for spicy tuna rolls at $8 a pop. Whaaaa? First, we didn't eat spicy tuna. We're told that's what they charge for vegetable rolls because they're not on the menu. Okay...but again, we didn't order spicy tuna, in fact we ordered the very opposite. And $8 a roll means we would pay $2 per PIECE of vegetable sushi. No way, man. \n\nIt was only after haggling with our server and two managers that we were able to have our bill reduced to a more appropriate price. Unfortunately, the whole experience sealed the deal on being totally over the place. \n\nAnd so begins the search for a new sushi joint... if anyone has suggestions for killer sushi (that includes creative rolls), I'm all ears!",0

Even though I ordered a side salad for my lunch they brought it out as if it were an appetizer.  15 minutes later everyone else was served.  \n\nDespite this oversight, everyone seemed to enjoy their meals and they had us in and out in a reasonable amount of time, so they are OK in my book.",2

When the bartender finally made his way over to us, we ordered a beer and a margarita, to which he responded \""Uhh, that's gonna be 8 something... maybe.\"" So my boyfriend just handed him a $10 and told him to keep it. Really? Shouldn't he know how much to charge?\n\nWhen we finally got seated, we decided on nachos for an appetizer. They came out in one big pile of squishy mush. The meat was decent, but everything else tasted bland, and well.. mushy.\n\nWe ordered our entrees, and waited. And waited. And watched other people order and eat. And waited..... and waited... for 45 minutes, we waited. We actually considered just leaving (which I have never done and couldn't ever actually do).

We said no, he went to the kitchen, came back and told us they had boxed it up to go but that he would  bring it out now.\nYuck! I don't want food that's been sitting around in boxes for 45 minutes when I go out to eat. So my boyfriend told him we didn't want our food anymore and we'd just pay for the appetizer and leave.\n\nAt least we were too full of mushy nachos to really be hungry for the rest of our food.\n\nIn short, don't go to Laredo's.",0

The shopkeeper is lovely and chatty, and if you can't find anything, it's best to ask, because the shops small size makes it quite crammed with stuff.\n\n All in all, a great place to quench your artistic thirst for equipment, and with the student discount it makes it a bit more affordable.",4

Their banh mi have never been especially generous in the meat department, but this time it was pretty sad.  It was mostly made of pickled veggies.

When my plate came out I must admit, I was a little disappointed, I only had 4 ravioli! But, to my pleasant surprise, these tiny pillows actually had a lot of filling inside and the sauce was so delicious I had to refrain from licking my plate (good thing I passed on the wine). JB chose the Lomo Saltado, a Chinese inspired dish. The garlic rice was a nice touch, but I found the fries were a bit too crispy for my liking. \n\nAlas, time for dessert which we usually pass on, but not this time.

RnR Scottsdale's opening night was no different than previously stated.  \n\nThere was a much smaller food menu available, but they are Ready-N-Rolling (Rock-n-Roll, Rest-N-Relaxation, pick one or make up your own definition).  I had the new IPA by New Belgium (Fat Tire), Ranger.  Clean, smooth, not too hoppy.  The setting is comfortable and warm (heating on both upper and lower patios), TV's galore, great location on Scottsdale Road near RA and the Billet Bar.\n\nThere are a number of great names associated with this new endeavor and it shows.  They created a great vibe that will undoubtedly be the next contender for \""The Place\"" to be.  Beginning this Saturday morning, they will roll out breakfast for the first time.  The menu, hours of operation and location make this a home-run in my book.  (had to throw that in for all the spring training fans that will be in the area.)",4
722,0,"Was looking for a new coffee spot to check out on Saturday, and stopped in at Cargo.\n\nIt was okay.\n\nThe place is certainly nice bright and spacious. There are plenty of seating options and some nice cozy areas. There is a nice large table towards the back for larger groups. \n\nThe coffee was fine, but my chai was only okay. A little too milky and not enough chai flavor for me personally. The bear claw was really good. I passed on the food, because the low prices made me question how good the quality would be.\n\nThe staff all seemed nice, but the lady who took my order (a little older with bottle blonde hair and glasses) was slow and seemed confused. Perhaps she is new?\n\nThe atmosphere there isn't really my thing. The crowd was a little too snobby/hipster.\n\nMaybe I'll check it out again, but I won't rush back. Plenty of better coffee shops in town. If you want a stellar coffee shop experience, try Lakeside Street Coffee House.",2
723,0,This was our favorite buttet on the Strip.  My favorite dish was the shrimp & grits.  How do they get their grits that smooth and flavorful?  I'm a southern girl and had never tasted grits like that!  The chocolate mousse mango dessert served in a little cup was the most amazing dessert I've ever eaten!   The atomosphere here is much more sophisticated than the other buffets we tried in Vegas.  It was relatively quiet and a great place to eat and catch up with old friends.,4

726,0,"I give the food 4 stars; it's pretty decent although it is pricey for what you get.  But hey, it is the Strip after all.\n\nThe service I give 1/2 star (thus the average of about 2 stars).  We watched time and again as our waiter breezed past our table, without so much as a glance toward our empty glasses, in order to pander to larger groups.  Obviously he thought he was going to get bigger tips from them...turns out he was right.  It didn't have to be that way though.  \n\nHere is my tip to the Red 8 wait staff:  Don't make the customers ask you for everything; if all their glasses are empty ask them if they need some more water or another drink.  If they would like to box up the uneaten portion of their dinner, box it all up instead of half.  Ask them if they'd like dessert or anything else before you drop the check on their table.  Most importantly, even if your opinion is to the contrary, treat them as if they deserve to be dining in your fine restaurant.",0

I liked that they had a station of fresh juice, including horchata. Refreshing! Desserts had their own central \""island\"" complete with varying fine patisserie-worthy delights and a gelato station. \n\nWe had a late start to the day and caught a late lunch.

Truffle fries are a must get, and the chipotle ketchup was great as well.  The atmosphere is loud and modern, we enjoyed that.  \nThe waitstaff was the part not quite up to par with what I would expect from a GR restaurant.  They could be a bit more attentive and less social with each other and pay attention to the customers.  \nThe wait was fine, greeters were nice.\nOverall it's a $50-$75 burger trip, but the uniqueness and experience is worth it.",3

There was no place to sit, no place to actually dance (crowded dance floors), and every EXIT was blocked off. LV's fire marshal needs to inspect this place ASAP!

733,0,"I was cruising down Williams Field the other night and Freddy's just kinda jumped out at me - had never noticed it there before, apparently because it just recently opened.  Brak loves a good burger, and being hungry at the time, I had to pull in and check it out.  I ordered some sort of double burger and fries.  It wasn't bad, but I wasn't terribly impressed either.  The burger patties were thin with some weird consistency that I can't even describe.  They were somewhat overcooked.  The bun & fixins were fine, and that helped somewhat.  The fries were super-thin and coated with some sort of thin coating of batter before frying, and while they were tasty enough, their thinness made them somewhat of a pain to dip in Heinz's finest and made for having to grab a bunch of them at a time to mow through them without taking forever.  I'll probably give Freddy's another go at some point, and maybe try something else on the menu.  This joint requires further study for a comprehensive conclusion.  Brak will be back!",0
734,0,"As Demetria said, this place is definitely hit and miss. If you want some good eats, get here early. They tend to run out of the real goodies.\n\nFried-chicken, when it isn't too overcooked/dried out, is a home run. I just wish they would perfect cooking it. I swear it alternates every other visit having it cooked perfectly.  Their six-cheese spaghetti is pretty good but can suffer the same fate at the chicken. Sides are plentiful to choose from. Mac-n-Cheese..same case as above. It's a home run if it hasn't been too burnt on top. Love their blackeyed peas and cornbread too. They might just have the best lemonade in Charlotte and I'm too scared to ask if it's just a brand-name mix. I really don't want to know. If you can bypass one of the volunteer's who fills up the drinks, you can make yourself a pretty slammin' Arnold Palmer.\n\nSpeaking of the volunteers, they're always extremely friendly and will even give you an extra dollop of mac-n-cheese if you know how to charm 'em like I do. Be sure to tip at the register.\n\nYour pal,\nWalter",3
735,0,Found this place through yelp. Service and food was amazing. I got an omelet as a scramble and the eggs were cooked perfectly. The biscuit was also toasted for me on the grill which I loved! ONE WARNING! The portions are GIGANTIC! I barely finished half my omelet. My boyfriend got the mamas and it looked like something out of man vs. food! If you hung over and hungry this is the place to go!,3
737,0,"A shi-shi sports bar with an appetizing menu executed in a very average manner.  \n\nThe current tenants of this space (previously Daddy Macs, and Blue Wave before that) have stuck with the existing deep red on black decor and subdued lighting. Very Victorian. It harkens back to the supper clubs of the olden days. I half expect to find gentlemen in top hats when I entered the door. Instead I only found a few mid-day drinkers playing video poker.  Being a sports bar, of course there are wide-screens all over the shop, which seem a bit anachronistic given that the place is swathed in late 19th-century red velvet drapery.\n\nInterestingly, the owners have placed a few old-fashioned items on the menu, such as baked brie, which are juxtaposed with more modern tasters, such as the deep-fried mashed potato bites. The menu is fairly enticing.  Sadly the food falls short. It feels like everything here is made to sound impressive, but, looks and tastes like it was cooked at Wendy's. I would have assumed it was all fresh-made, but it all tastes to me like it originated in the freezer.\n\nToday, I tried the Chicken Florentine Soup. It definitely came from a can.  No doubt about it. Then I got a California Turkey Burger.  The lettuce was limp, the avocado was almost non-existent, and the turkey patty was too salty.  However, there was a nice char on the patty, and I do love grill marks.\n\nMy main complaint is that this swanky restaurant has tremendous potential and no one here seems to know how to reach it.  The menu was promising. The descriptions of each item got me salivating.  Unfortunately, my dining experience turned out to be like a bad blind date:  your friend tells you how great this hamburger is, and then you finally meet it... and it is nothing compared to the burger you tasted in your dreams.\n\nMy advice to Elixir: if you're going to do gourmet pub food, actually do gourmet pub food.  It's just not right to titillate a person's tongue without bringing the taste buds to climax; wink, wink.",0
738,0,"Pretty decent.  My date (a Korean BBQ aficionado) even gave an almost imperceptible nod of approval.\n\nThe service was fast and friendly.  Restaurant is a little cold, but once the grill fired up and we knocked back some Hite, we were fine.\n\nWe chose the 4-meat option  for the AYCE.  Good, decently marinated beef and pork ribs.   Avoid the shrimp which were mushy like they'd been frozen for years.  gross.   Most of the traditional accompaniments were there.  Although no little bowl of sea salt.  :-(\n\nAll in all, good value for the money.  I'll go back.  AND, they get an extra star for having free sticks of gum next to the toothpicks on your way out.\n\nThat'll do Pig.  That'll do.",3

745,0,Ive seen this restaurant for many years but never had a chance to check this place out. Well today was the day I pulled a U turn and said its time for me to try it.\n\nI am pleased I made the decision. Their service was excellent. Maybe it's because we were the only people in there that made it easy for them to pay attention too us but what made the real difference is there attitude. I felt the conversation we were having was very sincere.  They really wanted to get to know me. \n\nI only tried 3 dishes. Roast duck curry which was ok.  The best part of the dish was the curry sauce. I have a feeling if I had it with chicken or beef it would've been much better.  The garlic shrimp was also ok.  I was expecting larger shrimps than the ones used.  The best dish we had was the crispy pork with Ong Choy.  The blend of vegetable with the crispy pork was perfect and seasoned right. \n\nThe price is a little bit higher than I expected. It's about $2-$3 more than other Asian restaurants.,2
746,0,"Few high class restaurants appreciate a group of rowdy mid-20 year old Las Vegasers. But Biscayne handled it with poise and played along.

Meat that was just flown in, delicious sides, and taste testing from the kitchen. Our next round of drinks (sadly) was not Miller Lite cans from our hotel room floor, but drinks from the bar and they were superb!\n\nGreat experience!

The staff was very friendly, and helpful.  My party of 8 ordered a lot of food and our server never forgot any of our orders.  There was so much cajun food to choose from...from Etoufee to crawfish.  I really recommend their Cravin' Cajun flavored shrimp and clams!  We also tried the lemon pepper one as well, but liked their signature seasoning better.  Their sweet potato tots were yummy and their fried catfish was delicious and fresh.  Their fried oysters were crispy and plump.  We tried their chicken wings (which were a good full size) and it came with a lemon pepper sauce on the side.  Their dessert was a little overpriced for the size it came in.  We ordered a keylime pie for $3-$4  and it was  this dinky cupcake-looking tart.  I don't recommend dessert, but the seafood was bomb.",4
748,0,Never really had a problem with this chipotle But had a terrible experience today. Employees were super rude from start to finish. Awful customer service. The lady at the end started rolling my burrito before I was even finished ordering. Never asked if I wanted anything else. Brought it home and right as I began to eat I noticed a decent sized black line on my tortilla - sharpie. Avoided the entire middle of my burrito. Sharpie isn't toxic but it's still not good to ingest. Disappointing because this chipotle is very close to my house. But it isn't much farther to go to 90th and Shea. I will not be returning to this location.,1
749,0,"Our original intention was to go to Texas Land and Cattle, but apparently it has closed down. We headed off down Harris Boulevard in search of something else to satisfy a desire for steak. Since I-85 is such a hassle with rush-hour traffic and now all that construction, we decided not to endure more of that and not trek further for a Texas Roadhouse steak. Passing the highway on-ramp, we remembered Longhorn's existed. I used to live in the area and had been a there a few times before, years and years ago.\n\nWe both ordered steaks, my friend the NY Strip and I -- my preferred cut -- the ribeye. We got our drinks and bread the same time as the side salads. My tea was a bit bitter, the side salad was decent but bland. I prefer other place's blue cheese dressing to Longhorn's. This place's was a bit watered down.\n\nThe steak and potato arrived after we finished the salads. My friend enjoyed his, and I thought mine was fine. It was a bit tough and chewy, but not enough to send back. I finished it all and was fairly satisfied and definitely full.\n\nEveryone has their preferences, and for about the same price, I prefer Texas Roadhouse. They are more tender and juicy in my opinion, as well as thicker and more marbled. I like their tea much better (less bitter and more sweet) and their side salads (dressing there is thicker with less iceberg lettuce). They serve rolls instead of sliced bread, which i also prefer. So, I guess maybe is all down to preference, and I prefer Texas Roadhouse.\n\nAs for the service, that was a-okay. No problems there, minus the urge to up-sell, which I find quite annoying, but I accept it is a part of eating out. Our server was quick on the refills and checked in to make sure the meals was (as she put it), \""okay.\""\n\nAs the star rating and the server said, it was all \""okay.\"" Not a place I would return to unless it was someone else's idea and they had the desire for it.

We went on a Tuesday night so it started off pretty dead so the rotation went quickly and we got to sing about 3 times each.  As the night wore on, it got more packed and by midnight we were sure we weren't going to get to sing again.  The ambiance and the crowd just makes singing so much fun!  They cheer you on and dance and sing along.  The sound system is great too.  They have TVs all over the bar with the lyrics displayed.  They also seem to have a good selection of music.\n\nWe went back on a Friday night and that place was PACKED to the hilt.  We put our names in and ended up having to wait about 1 1/2 hours to sing.

I tried not to look and just grab the food/stuff i wanted (which is kinda overpriced!), pay at the counter and leave as soon as possible.

765,0,"A couple months ago my friend and I saw a special on the Wynn Buffet on the food network and were so impressed, we put it on our must do list on our Vegas VaCa.\n\nWe knew ahead of time, it would be expensive. It was like 40 a person for dinner. And we were prepared to pay.\n\nThe food was disgusting. We went on a Saturday night so it should have been busy enough for the food to rotate though. Everything I ate was dry and nasty. Like when you leave meat out for a few hours and the top of it crusts over. Or noodles that are half mushy half dried out hard. And the meats at the carving station was extra, extreme rare, borderline raw. \n\nI really thought there would be more selections. But in all seriousness, it's not at all bigger than your average neighborhood asian buffet. Except it's stretched out in a long line instead of cramped together. Because asian buffets do have american food and pasta and pizza. It's nasty, but it's the same nastiness of this buffet.\n\nI thought the plates were beautiful. But I don't want to pay 40 dollars to eat on a nice plate.\n\nOn the upside, we recieved very good service.They were quick, and continually took our plates and refilled our drinks. We were however RIGHT next to their waiting station though. lol. The wait in line was pretty fast too. We probably waited less then 15 minutes. (On a busy night at HomeTown Buffet, (in the ghetto btw ;P  ) the wait time can be a freaking hour). \n\nAlthough our table wasn't that far, most of them were like a maze. I think I would definitely have gotten lost. However, like only a few feet from our table was a giant pile of dirty dishes, near the employee entrance. If I hadn't have been so obsessed with the disappointment of the food, I would have noticed that while I was there. Oh, but we have plenty of pictures with a huge stack of dirty dishes in the background.\n\nI have to add that the line for crab legs is ridiculously long. It's a good 20 minutes in the line, but what makes it ridiculous is that the crab legs aren't worth it a bit. I got a plate full of it and ended up not eating any of them. I can't put my finger on it. It's too salty, but that's not the problem. I can' only relate it to having a metallic taste of it. I don't know what it is.

766,0,"I was in the Summerlin neighborhood, and had this spot bookmarked, so thought I would give it a try!  I've read earlier reviews, and it looks like they have established themselves nicely now.  The interior is very upscale, which wine glasses and fancy wood furniture.  The dining area is small, but nicely designed.  Wine bottles are fancily displayed in wooden shelves behind the bar.  There is even a small outside dining area, which might be nice on a summer night.  The easy listening music would have touched my inner yuppie, if I had one.\n\nI had no issues with the service.  I made a bit of small talk with one of the waitresses, and she explained that Nittaya's has only been open for two months.  My water was always full, and they asked me how my food was.  This also was the first Thai restaurant I've been to where the waitress folded my napkin over my lap.  I wasn't even with anyone!  Can't complain there. \n\nMy order: Thai tea, Crab Wontons, and Curry catfish.  \nOverall impression: descent, Americanized Thai.\n\nThai tea was average, very creamy, but not very flavorful.  I would go ahead and skip the Thai tea at Nittaya's.  The water though had fruit in it!  This is how my old stoming grounds, Thai Grill, does their water, and it makes for a very refreshing, slightly tangy drink.  \n\nThe Crab Wontons were a little bland on the inside.  They used some sort of either immitation crab, or low quality crab, mixed with cream cheese and a couple of herbs.  The fried shells were nice though, thick and well prepared.   They came with two sauces, a sweet sauce and a spicy one.  Both were good sauces, particularly the spicy one, and they made the crab wontons definitely more doable.  Overall though, I wasn't too impressed.  \n\nThe curry catfish was alright.. not great, not bad though.  The curry sauce was thick, and on the sweet side, but in this case that was ok because catfish is always a little better with sweetness to offset the \""dry\"" catfish taste.  The portion was a little small for the $13 price tag.  The curry came with a nice change of pace though: baby bok choy.  This did give the curry a little bit of a unique taste, I and enjoyed it.  \n\nOverall, due to the sweetness of the curry, and the not-so-thrilling crab wontons, I wouldn't go out of my way to eat at Nittaya's again over some of the better, more authentic Thai restaurants in Vegas (see my List), but it would be a good spot to bring a date or the parents maybe.",2

They pick up trash in my neighbor hood, I am a renter, trash is provided by the homeowner who is now in foreclosure and not paying her bills.  RAD stopped my trash service and would not allow me the renter to start my own service unless I paid the past due balance of the homeowner.  They said because I used the service I should pay for it even though the service was set up in the homeowners name and delinquent by the homeowner.

771,0,"I checked out this dealership on Yelp prior to visiting them as I found them online and was interested in a truck they had listed on Cars.com.  I read the Yelp reviews... some great, and some poor and decided I'd make a visit to see the truck even though they had some pretty bad reviews on here.\n\nI don't live in Vegas, but am in town right now for Pubcon (a Search Marketing conference) for the next few days.  I contacted them and let them know I wanted to set up an appointment with them on Wed. morning to see the specific truck I was interested in.  We scheduled the appointment a few days prior to me being in town.  I then called them Wed. morning about an hour prior to my appointment to confirm the appointment and to make sure the truck I wanted was there.  I let them know I'd be by in about an hour and was looking forward to seeing the truck.  Appointment confirmed.\n\nI show up at 9:45 am, about 50 min. after I called and am greeted outside by a sales woman.  She brings me in, sits down and asks my name, pulls up my appointment and then takes me over to see the manager.  The manager pulls up my appointment and says to me - \""oh, you're hear to see truck X, (not listing what I want so I don't get spammed here by other dealers) it's really nice.\""  She then calls over a salesman to take me over to the trucks location and show it to me.  I head out the door with him and after a hundred yards or so as we're heading toward another building he tells me that the truck I am interested in was sold yesterday.\n\nAt this point, I'm annoyed! not because the truck is sold, but because NO ONE told me that when they had a chance to save me the trouble and time it took to go there, check in, talk to the manager, etc.  I'm in town on business and making a trip out of my way to see this truck and they knew it was sold... so why keep my appointment? Why invite me in?  Why send me to the manager and a salesman?  Simple answer, they figured why tell him it's sold; let's just get him in here and see if we can sell him something else instead.  PROBLEM is that is a total waste of my time.\n\nInitially I thought, maybe they didn't know it had sold when we spoke on the phone to confirm the appointment???  Now that I've thought about it more, I don't buy it though and that's why I'm giving them a bad review here and I don't buy the manager telling me: \""oh, you're hear to see truck X, it's really nice\"" and here's why.  After I spoke to the manager and she called over the salesman she wanted to help me, we walked right outside and began talking while walking toward the lot and on the way he told me the truck had sold.  He didn't have any paperwork to check on it, he didn't call anyone on the way, we didn't go to an empty stall and then he called someone and said, where is X truck at?  He just knew that I was there to see the truck and it had sold the day before.\n\nAnyway, after he told me the truck had sold I told him my visit there was a waste of time and that I wished they would have told me earlier, etc.  He quickly checked his inventory to see if they had anything else on the lot that was similar to what I wanted and they didn't and that was that, I left.",0
772,0,I came here for a late lunch/early dinner. There was one party of people in front of me and most of the restaurant was empty but there was still about a 10 minute wait. The d\u00e9cor is somewhat sad when you think of a place that is in a hotel like Aria. The d\u00e9cor looked old and faded with scuff marks all round. While the view was pretty I was seated at a table that had the sun shining directly in my face and there are no window shades. \n\nWe ordered the Fish & Chips and the Jambalaya Pasta. I have to say that the Fish & Chips was kind of a mess with the batter being kind of soggy and the fries just kinda bland. It wasn't worth the $22 bucks that it costs except for that it was a rather large portion. The Jambalaya pasta was another large portion and was decent but again nothing overly wonderful. The chicken in it was a bit dry and it was swimming in sauce. That dish was also $22 bucks but again wasn't really worth the money.  \n\nWe finished eating and didn't even want to bother taking our left overs. So we paid and got out as quickly as possible. I usually think that hotel coffee shops are pretty much the same with sub-par food and this one was the same. Which I think is a shame since there are so many other higher quality eateries in the Aria to choose from. You're better off grabbing some coffee and a pastry from Jean Philippe Patisserie.,1

774,0,"Dinner there this past weekend. Ive waited three days to write a review to allow some distance from the evening and see if I feel better about it. I don't. \nOur reservation for four were for 7:pm. We arrived promptly and were all very excited, we had been planning this dinner for a while. We requested a table on the porch and were seated and addressed by the waiter quickly. The table ordered a full bodied bottle of Pinot Noir wine on the recommendation of the waiter, when it arrived it was the label he recommended but (even by his own admission) the wine didn't have a taste profile that met the expectation he set. It was good but a thin light Pinot with little body and not what we anticipated. We kept the bottle to be cordial and it was enjoyed in spite of the mistake. Not a big deal... \nWe ordered our appetizers at about 7:30. We received them at about 8:20 (they had one large table but were not full by any means) this could have been forgivable had the appetizers not arrived staggered leaving two plates undelivered and two sitting on the table. When they all finally arrived the food was great. \nWhile waiting for the main course I went to the restroom. The mens room was filthy. The back of the toilet looked like it hadn't been cleaned in days. Ive seen dive bars with cleaner facilities. The wall has black scuff marks obviously from people using a foot to flush the toilet. The tiny trash can was overflowing and the floor had water (I hope) all over it. I couldn't believe it possible for a restaurant of this caliber to allow their facilities to be so poorly kept.\nI returned to the table and we began the wait for our dinners. They arrived another 45 minutes after the appetizers (it was past 9pm). Our Dinner portions were meager and all of the entrees lacked vegetables or greenery of any kind. It was clear the focus was on form over food. The plating was beautiful but the meal itself was so so.  By the time we finished eating and were ordering dessert it was almost 10pm. We were given an apology by the waiter (who aside from the wine mistake, was fantastic). The manager also stopped by for a moment to apologize however the four chocolate truffles he sent to the table as an apology for dinner turning into a three + hour event were hardly a compensation for the wait, the wine issue, the mediocre dinner, or the condition of the facilities. For the price we paid (in time as well as money) the value simply isnt there in my opinion. Perhaps they just had an off night... I know we certainly wont take the risk again to find out, there are too many great places to eat in downtown.",0

776,0,I am not a great golfer by any means. But i do love the sport. this course is great for beginners and good golfers alike. It's wide open with few houses in a hittable location unless you REALLY get a hold and slice or pull badly. water is a recurring nightmare and provides some good challenges. Greens were in pretty good shape. not perfect but compared to other courses for under 50 dollars a round I haven't found any better. \n\nThe part that sets this place a part from courses i go to is the employees and service. from the clubhouse counter all the way through to the food service were the best I've experienced.  ll actually have starters rolling around DOING their job and pushing the very slow groups along. My green fee included some draft beers and some food which i didn't plan on. and to top it off unlimited range balls. It was the best Saturday of golf I've had in Vegas.,4

783,0,"This review is mostly for the Emergency Room.  I had a bike crash on a Friday at lunch hour.  I rode my bike home, to ditch my computer and work files, and to make sure it was safe.  Took a taxi to Good Sam, and it took almost the entire taxi ride for my insurance to verify I was headed to an ER that is \""in Network.\""  Pretty stresful, but once I walked through the doors, most of that changed.\n\nSure, there was a lot of painful waiting around in a hallway in a wheelchair.  But, hey, it's an emergency room.  I found the system to be very organized and the employees to be helpful and compassionate.  There were a couple of fails on the doctor's part.  She offered me pain meds, and then forgot to order them.  I had to ask a nurse, and then they arrived quickly.  Doc also forgot to order antibiotics for my road rash, but I received a voice mail shortly after discharge that hooked me up with germ-fighters.\n \nWhen I was discharged, I indicated I intended to walk to Walgreens, since I live in the neighborhood.  I was referred to the hospital pharmacy, which I expected to soak me.  But it only cost me $14 for 2 kinds of pain meds and stool softener (yes, I said it and no, it hasn't worked yet).  Pharmacy gave me a beeper and I was able to peruse the lovely and overpriced gift shop.  If I was hospitalized, there were many items there that I would appreciate receiving.  Good gift shop.\n\nI was there for approximately 4.5 hours.  I had triage, xrays, and an EKG.  I was admitted immediately, no waiting.  I don't have much experience with ERs, so there you go.\n\nProps to the skinny blond \""tech\"" guy, who entertained me by exchanging restaurant reviews while he irrigated my wound.",4
784,0,This is my first time in Madison and my first restaurant we visited.  Well if my experience at marigold kitchen is what Madison is about....this will be my last visit here.  When we approached the counter we were immediately treated as though we were NOT welcome.  I felt more like an inconvenience then a customer.  When we sat my food arrived 15 minutes before the rest of my table did so I ate cold food.  Marigold kitchen...you should be ashamed.  I would recommend McDonald's before marigold kitchen.

785,0,"Old navy...\nI used to work for this company. There are so many positives behind this brand and its sister brands that I have a hard time writing a negative review now. So let me specify that this review applies exclusively to the Desert Ridge location.\nThe store set up is awful. The stock is seemingly always too low for the square-footage. The visuals look as though there was no thought or effort put into them whatsoever; and today, the service I received while shopping with my mother was atrocious.\nWe found some great deals, made our way over to the registers, and stood there, waiting; just waiting for one of the four associates (two of which I'm positive were managers or leads of some sort) to notice and assist us. There were no other customers. I had to loudly announce our presence; and when a teenage girl finally did meander her way over to us, she was rude and inattentive. \nSo sad to see such a great company give such a horrible experience. Next time, we'll take our business to the Scottsdale road location.",0
786,0,"Bar Alba is undoubtedly one of the most attractive looking bars in the Grassmarket. Its sleek, striking aesthetic is a step away from the traditional, broody look of the other boozers in this area. It steers away from the cosy tavern appeal, opting for flashy style instead.\n\nIt certainly looks gorgeous and very upmarket, but I am unsure of exactly what atmosphere it exudes. We might've just been there on a quiet night but there weren't that many people in the bar which was a bit awkward. I liked the low lighting and it looked very swanky but I felt sorry for the barmaid who must've been getting really bored without people to serve!\n\nIt's pricier than some pubs in Edinburgh, but due to its location I'm hardly surprised. It's got the old town tax, but my friend who is from near Edinburgh thought it was reasonable for booze so I can't complain. They had a lot of high end whiskys, including Highland Park which I would recommend. \n\nBar Alba is nice but it didn't feel very alive despite the fact it was the middle of the Fringe. There was something quite eerie about drinking in a deserted bar, so although the staff were very polite and the bar was lush, I can't award any more stars. I'd be willing to give it a second shot since it's a nice place to drink, but preferably on a night with more of a buzz.",2
787,0,Feeling generous with the one star today. Food was good but service was lacking. I don't believe that you should have to wait 30-40minutes for water to arrive at your table or watch your appetizer pot steam for that long either.  The bad service outweighed the food this time. Disappointed. Seems like the Melting Pot should read some of these reviews to make improvements.,0

They also now have buckets of ice for the mimosa champagne. *fist pump*\n\nThey still don't describe some of their menu items quite well enough (which can be a serious issue for vegetarians and vegans).  But the menu has also been expanded to the point where frankly it's a little too long -- though I will forgive that because the brunch menu is just right and they added a delicious pretzel bread appetizer.  Skip the tomato jam; the cheese sauce is all you need (though the honey mustard is good too).\n\nThey also really kick it up a notch with lots of different happy hours (depends on the day) and other specials.

At the entrance, behind a glass display, are a variety of yummy looking cakes. I'm not one to balk at cake but I wish the display was filled with baklava, jalibeh, and a bunch of other Middle Eastern desserts to fit with the restaurant better.\n\nAuthenticity aside, I can at least say they do better than most Chinese restaurants do when it comes to representing their country's cuisine.",2

All the old timey jars and various candy that you remember from when you were a kid. \n\nThe bread is fresh, the bakery has extremely wonderful things and even the flowers that I bring home as often as I can seem to last a little longer than they do from other places. \n\nBut this is the only location that seems to have this feel so I will continue to shop only in the store on Providence Road.",4

820,0,"I found quality items that were fairly priced based upon the current fashion trends and what was made available.  my only complaint was that i was encouraged to leave items at the front counter so that my arms were free to continue shopping and at a time sensitive (i had to go out of town) check out, an important item was left out of my pile of things.  this resulted in my being inconvenienced due to my schedule and the long distance driven to get to Turn Style to shop.  When I called the store I was told that the items could not be held for me for a few days until I was able to get back there to pick them up.  This was a customer service faux pas that showed absolutely no personal attention. I spent a sumptuous amount in their store and it was too inconvenient for them to accommodate me given their clerical error?  After four more phone calls over the next couple of days I finally was able to receive good customer service as I was promised the item would be held for me until my return date.  I am planning to see if they truly are customer service oriented when I travel the 15 miles to their store to fetch my item supposedly on hold for me.  We shall see.  \n\nAs consignments shops go, I am impressed with the organization, the cleanliness and fresh fragrance of the store (as opposed to that typical thrift store odor), and I found the staff otherwise extremely kind and pleasant if not efficient given my debaucle.\n\nI will continue to shop there because of the quality and variety of their items and I will also be sure to see that every item I chose is included in the check out.",0

823,0,"The current rating on this place, as of 5/23/14, is three and a half stars. This is about right for King's Fish House. \n\nWe started out with the calamari. The portion seemed about right but the breading was fragile. It came off easily and also tasted a little oily. Food Network told me that could happen due to the oil not being hot enough. \n\nMy dining companion ordered the lobster bisque, which was missing a certain je ne sais quoi... He asked for the bisque to be replaced with a clam chowder and that, too, wasn't very good. It tasted under seasoned and floury. I figure if you are going to call yourself a fish house, then you should have a pretty epic clam chowder...\n\nMy cioppino was very tasty and well worth the cost. The crab claws were my favorite part but the broth brought it all together. I would order it again. My partner liked his fried shrimp. \n\nThe service was good. Give it a try; maybe you'll think it's better than my three and a half star rating (but I doubt it).",0

I ordered fish and chips, my daughter ordered a burger and onion rings, my husband ordered sandwich and onion ring.  We waited long time to get our drinks and food.  When we got the food I was very disappointed.  My fish was so greasy that I had to blot out the oil on my napkin which soaked my napkin.  My fries greasy and when I picked it up it was limp and very salty.  My husband gave me his onion rings and it was same as my fries (greasy and salty).  It looks to me they just dropped the fries and onion rings for few seconds and took it out.  My daughter said her burger was worse than Mcdonalds burger.  I had to flag down our waitress as she never came by to see how our food was and told her the fries were uneatable and would like a sald instead.  I only asked for olive oil and lemon wedges and my daughter asked for ranch dressing for the burger.  The lettuce in salad was wilted.  I was only able to stomach couple bites.  When we finally got the bill she charged us for the Ranch dressing.  When I sent e-mail to Zipps the response I got was that they have the highest quality food and the prices area very reasonable.  It is customary to charge for side of Ranch and that they hope I would give them a try again.  I don't think so.",0

When I got home I examined the shirts and found that every shirt had a small rip/ tear on the top left sleeve.  I brought all shirts back to them and showed the owners Son all shirts.  He agreed that it was probably caused by something on the equipment. He asked that I leave a shirt so he could accurately describe the problem to his Mom when she came back later in the day. He told me she would call me. I did not receive a call back, so I stopped by on the way to work and discussed the issue. The owner said that she had never seen me before, and there was nothing she could do. She stated that there was no way to know if I brought the shirts to her in a damaged condition. She stated that if I was a \"" regular customer\"" maybe she could do something. So......I am out 14 dress shirts plus the cost of \"" cleaning\"" them.  I felt that the owner thought I was trying to run a scam on her.  Not a very good experience.  I would most definitely avoid this place of business for my business shirts.

NO VOLUME why even have a tv in the 1st place? \nOMG if you've read my reviews you know that is a deal killer for me. and I'll end up somewhere else. \nWe ordered wings and 2 salads. This must have annoyed this waitress b/c we never saw her again? she spent the ENTIRE time kissing the next table's ass. .and I mean giggling like a teenager at everything this table's patrons had to say, and would by pass us like nothing. \nmy bf finally said I guess my empty glass is invisible?  I figured it must have been. When we finally did get her attn and flagged her down to get the check - her whole tone changed. I guess the high pitched giggly tone and helpful attitude was reserved only for certain tables and ours wasnt up. Maybe we didnt spend enough? \nsorry but I'm only going to order what I'm willing to actually eat. \n\nWINGS: The wings were ok. we ordered HOT and garlic cilantro. The garlic cilantro had ZERO flavor. I was really disappointed b/c I like both A LOT. garlic is up there w/ salt & pepper in my household. The hot good though, but they were very very very VERY greasy. I think i used every napkin in the place. more napkins than BWW or HOOters cant be good in the calorie dept. and the taste wasnt that far above and beyond so IMHO the nxt time I go I'll probably try something else, and maybe get it to go to avoid bad waitressing.",0

844,0,"I went to Vegas for 1 night (Sunday night) for my company and Palms was the chosen one.  I took my friend with me too because work was only a small part of the day.  I had the standard room.  First of all, I have stayed in vegas for many times in various hotels, from 4 Queens in downtown to the suite at the Venetian.  I was not impressed at all given that this is a 4-star hotel.  I had better luck at the 4 Queens.\n\nWe arrived the hotel at around 11am in a limo.  No bell boys or anybody at the door to help with my luggage. Thanks for my limo driver for holding the hotel door for me.  We took my suitcase and stuff to the lobby.  Right away, I saw the big MTV spring break week.  I thought it was going to be a good time tonight.  Got to the front desk and was told no room was available because check-in time was not until 3pm.  I was bumped because I had no makeup on yet and now forced to walk around vegas until 3.  They said they would give me a call when the room's ready and probably around 2pm.  So I was like \""Fine, I will put makeup on in the restroom here and just go have lunch on the strip.\""  Took my luggage to the bell desk, so did everybody.  A line was formed by college kids (probably for the mtv event) where everybody brought a week load of drinks and food.  By food I mean like couple of coolers for each person, from yogurts to canned food, chips, alcohol, and more chips and alcohol.  Finally got out of the hotel and arrived at the Bellagio at 12:30pm!  \n\nI was tired (early flight) and starving.  So we had lunch at the Olives, did what I came here for, did some shopping at the Forum shops, bought my Lion King tix, had a light meal at Max Benner.  It was already 4:30 with no calls.  I was getting annoyed and decided to go back to the hotel and yelled at them.  On the way to the hotel, they finally called me at 4:45 and said the room was ready!  \n\nGot to the hotel again, lots of drunk college girls in bikinis and boys stalling and yelling.  Got to my floor, right away saw the vending machine and ice machine was out of order (where do I get my water now?).  A cleaning lady was still working on this floor.  Got to the room, it was dated and did not have a desk.  There was a full length mirror with no lights above it  (BAD design), no magnifying mirror in bathroom.  But the bathroom was huge.  Called up the housekeeping for slippers but never brought to the room.  We told ourselves it was only 1 night.  So we let all the negativities go and started to get all dolled up for tonight while watching the Real Housewives of OC.  \n\nWhen we got back down to the lobby, no more bikinis but skimpy dresses.  We looked like an old fart because we both wore a knee high dress (we are still in mid 20s!).  Whatever.  Got to the taxi line, heard a bunch of girls asking some interesting questions like \""do I need cash to take the cab?\"", \""can I pick what cab to hop on?\"" etc.  \n\nGot back to the hotel around 1130 and there was a huge line for the Ghostbar.  So I kindly asked if I could skip a little bit of the line because I was a guest here.  She replied, \""No, this is a popular club.  Everybody needs to get in the line.\""  We were so bumped because we were asked to get in The Bank for free.  But we passed that because we had faith in the Palms.  We ended up going to the 24 hour cafe and ate.  The food was decent.  It was quiet and peaceful compared to all the yelling and drunk flirt outside.  The server was very nice too.\n\nOverall, it was not a good experience.  The floor plan was hard to navigate (I couldn't find the concierge).  Staff was not helpful nor trying to be (when asked for direction, they would just point and say nothing, no \""thank you\"" or any form of greetings).  I have no plans to stay there again.",0

I loved these so much. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  \n\nDislikes: \n-None really but could be slightly cleaner.  I was going to sit at one booth near the outside but saw the seat was a bit dusty so I decided to find a new one. Not a huge deal though.  \n\nLike or Dislikes depending on your preference:\n-It's an old diner look but it adds to the fun of the place, IMO. \n\nVerdict: This is a great place for breakfast and much cheaper than Chez Cora.

848,0,"We drive by this one all the time and noticed it said on the sign this one is their liquor liquidation center. Cool! I definitely wouldn't mind a liquor outlet as we collect all kinds of spirits and maybe, just maybe they'll have something quality on sale. \n\nWe browse around and well, the prices are regular Lees prices. I was hard pressed to find liquidation anything. I know my alcohol and I know the going rate for a lot of things because useless facts is how I roll. Either way, misleading.\n\nI guess the plus for visiting Lee's is there are a few things they have that TW&M doesn't have that perked my interest, but not enough to buy them. \n\nThey have a few endcaps with big \""sales\"" and one caught my eye with local Las Vegas Distillery stuff. I ended up getting a bottle of Rumskey at the $21 price. It was a good price, but not a good deal as they lead to believe. They mention the regular price is $34.99 which I knew the going rate for their stuff was less than that last time I checked and almost bought a bottle. I happen to be at TW&M later in the day and $21.99 is the normal price there. Nice marketing strategy to make people feel good about purchases, but it's a false sense of it and not actually a sale, so boo. \n\nThere was only one cashier in the store and no one else that we saw, so probably would be difficult to ask questions. I come to Lee's knowing and feeling slightly sad that generally it is DIY. I like talking to people about their spirits of choice and helping narrow it down based on what they know of their product. I'm usually self sufficient in spirits knowledge, but sometimes I just want to know what other spirit folks are loving that may be not in my radar.  Some Lee's you can ask questions, but this is not the location for it. I know, I'm probably asking too much in a way since the demographics was pretty much \""party peeps\"" that beeline to their Bud Light... \n\nI love to support local, but I also love to support my collectors habits and I want to be able to feel good about my purchases.

852,0,"I hauled my mother along with me to visit the outlets, arriving at 10 am on a Friday (CMS schools were out, and it was Halloween - I thought this was going to be poor planning on my part, but it turned out okay).  \n\nWith the early arrival time during the work-week, I easily found a parking spot at the end of a row near Old Navy.  Be warned - the parking lot was designed by Helen Keller and there are WAY too many C (compact) parking spots.  Some of the compact cars we saw when leaving were a Navigator, a Sequoia, an Expedition and several full size sedans.  Stop with the damn compact parking.  (I know, I know... I work for an arch firm, parking spot quotas and whatnot, but STAHHHHP).\n\nFood Court is bleh.  And there is nothing really close to the outlets to eat.  Eat before or after, or know that you will need to get a cookie at the cookie joint and a coffee from Starbucks to snack on.  The Starbucks is not it's own store, it's more of an overgrown coffee stand/building in the middle of the walkway.  You're going to be standing in line outside and you have to keep moving.\n\nAs a chubby gal, I was happy to see the Old Navy.  Torrid (the big and tall whore store) is also located here, but everything was black and goth'y (I am fat, but I still like to wear colors).  They had great purse deals at the Kate Spade and Coach, though the folks at the Coach were stalking and I can't stand that.  Greet me when I come in and then leave me alone.  Outer wear was well priced at Eddie Bauer, as was the clearance section.  Yankee Candle had the large jars 4 for $44 (be aware that this is truly the outlet for YC - you typically won't find the same scents that they have in the stores/online, though some were stocked).  I was a little disappointed that the GH Bass store had mostly boots, but 'tis the season.\n\nLike Bruce K. said, if you have ever been to a Simon/Premium Outlet, you know what to expect.  This is very similar to the outlets that I have visited in Charleston in design and retailers.  A nice addition to the Charlotte area, and I will definitely return (at 10 am on Sundays or after the first of the year - I wouldn't come here during the holidays unless forced at gunpoint - it's going to be a shitshow).",0

When I saw their HUGE selection of tasty cakes all was forgiven and I spent ages deciding what cake to go for. \n\nAs it is a Turkish cafe, Cafe Truva has an excellent selection of Turkish foods and teas and as I looked around at other patrons I could see that there wasn't one thing on the menu that I wouldn't have liked. \n\nI devoured my large slice of chocolate cake in mere minutes and sipped my apple tea whilst doing a spot of people watching.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent cafe.

DOH,,  I ordered it med spicey,  it was plenty spicy, over powered the dish, the pad thai sauce was weak, the veggies didnt seem too fresh, the noodles were ehhhhhh.  The normal large portion was not so large.  I usually cant finish my meal, but i did tonight... I was disappointed in my selection tonight,  I will eat here again but i will stick to chinese food not thai... The boba was good though...  This joint isnt bad,, if i were with friends i would eat here, its not the best, but i give it a 2stars for my meal tonight.... Hope this yelps...\n\n06/17/14\nQuality in food has gone down hill...

I guess they sold out to Budweiser.  Not cool.  So having a pretty good time dancing in front of the guitarist playing sublime.  Not getting crazy or anything and the GM wants to call security on my friend because \""he's intoxicated\"".  Yes. HES IN A BAR IN A CASINO!   Duh. He was by no means being inappropriate or out of hand.  From running bars I know the difference.  After security gets there I talk to security and assure them that nothing is wrong.  Well GM bullshits and gets my boy kicked out.  Total douche move.  Even after I talk to him and try to reason he becomes even more of a fucking asshole and kicks me out for \""talking rowdy\"".  Really??   I'd like to see him outside and show him \""ROWDY\"".  This place is not part of Hard Rock and should be kicked to the fucking curb!!!",0
857,0,"Holy Cow Batman.  Ya gotta check this place out.  I am on a Thai food kick after 45+ years of avoiding it and this place is one of the best for sure!\n\n1.  Ambiance - Very nice, trendy, modern place good for dates or the family, trendy or casual.  Located on Horizon Ridge and Horizon Ridge in Henderson near the 215.  Easy access and parking.\n\n2.  Service - Pleasant, welcoming, just perfect.\n\n3.  Prices - Extremely reasonable. Not cheap, not expensive, just right.\n\n4.  Food -  What a great experience. We ordered all spice medium as to not get blown out and not be able to really taste the food.  Medium has a great kick to it, but not overpowering.  As they grade from 1-4, we actually ordered 2.5\n\na.  Tom Yum Soup - We ordered a small, just enough to share for two. Tasty, tender chicken, and just right.\n\nb.  Eggplant with Ground Pork - This is my comparison dish.  I order this at every Thai place and here, it was very, very nice. Tender eggplant, succulent ground pork. Could not ask for a better flavor.\n\nc.  Pad Kee Mau - this noodle dish they describe as \""Drunken Noodle\"" what Thai people order after a night of drinking. This is an amazing dish. The wide noodles are the right firmness, the sauce very flavorful, the chicken mean was very tender alsos.\n\nd.  Red Curry Chicken - WOW. You cannot go wrong with this.\n\n\n5.  Dessert - Sweet Sticky Rice with Mango Ice Cream.  Hubba bubba.  I am rolling out of this place now. Call for a tow truck.  I am gonna burst.\n\nDelicious.  GK says, check it out!\nOverall,",3

859,0,"I'm surprised to read that others thought the staff was friendly. In fact, the rudeness of the owner is the only reason I felt compelled to write this review. The food is good, if you can wait...sometimes 20 minutes before your order is even taken. I'm pretty sure the owner is the only person that works there, as he is the only one I see when I stop there (I practically work right across the street, so it's convenient). Since he is the only one who works there, he takes and order then goes and prepares it himself. This obviously takes FOREVER. And it would be fine if it was a small place, but there's got to be a dozen or more full size booths there plus some tables. Today when I was there during a slight rush of 3 or 4 groups of people trying to buy food, he became visibly flustered and I heard him say things to shaking his head at waiting customers saying things like \""when you decide what you want, let me know...I can't just stand here and wait,\"" \""Hold on, I can't help you right now\"" - and he's not saying these with a smile on his face to lighten the mood. He's just plain mean to his customers. When he brought me my food after about 30 minutes of waiting, he put the food down and then walked to the door and stuck his head outside to yell at someone for parking in front of his place and going to Saigon Noodles next door. Granted, he still had people waiting after me for food yet he felt it was necessary to yell at someone for not respecting his parking spaces. When clearly, he can barely handle the customers that where already there. He needs to HIRE SOMEONE, and I pity the person that has to work with him...",0

We showed up and got seated right away. Very small, quiet place. All the employees were very nice and our server was very helpful with suggestions. There were 5 of us so we just got a bunch of different things to share. This dish I chose was the lamb masala! AMAZING!! Very sweet/spicy sauce and that lamb was cooked perfectly. By the end of the meal everyone was so full and the bill was very reasonable. Overall great experience and will definitely be back to try the lunch buffet!",3

862,0,"I cannot begin to describe how much love I have for this place!  Every. Single. Item.  I have had has been amazing!  I have now officially had breakfast, lunch and dinner here.  Should I be proud?  I think strongly lean towards a yes!  \n\nI was lucky enough to meet a lovely bunch of yelpers here for lunch.  Lunch is my least favorite meal.  In my personal opinion, it's hard to make lunch items non boring.  I'm not really a sammie fan (unless it's drowned in something, like a Reuben drowned in 1000 Island).  I like salads, but only if they're full of ingredients.  You get the point, I want my lunches to be fabulous....and they're usually utterly boring.  SO not the case with my delish veggie wrap.  It was oozing with rich cheese, packed full of YUM-O grilled veggies (eggplant, squash, zuch, mushrooms, etc.) and toasted to perfections....even the wrap was toasted!  I was in veggie heaven!  \n\nFast forward to the next night (obsessed much!?) and I enjoyed the company of some other yelpers at Sugar for their fall tasting menu.  I'm all about dinner, usually because it leads to dessert!  But everything was beyond amazing.  The Butternut Squash soup had to be the best soup I had ever tasted in my life...I'm for serious!  I chose the Wild Salmon and potatoes.  While this was good, I was also able to sample the Root Veggie Pot roast was to die for!  The goat cheese mixed in with the crisp veggies was my heaven!  \n\nIf there's ever another tasting for dinner you MUST go!  They don't normally serve dinner, so it's a special circumstance.  But take advantage of their delicious sweet treats during the day...cupcakes, tiny crisp macaroons and freshly baked pound cakes. I'm in love!",4

I had my appointment and was told NOTHING that I didn't already know, after waiting almost 2 hours to see the doctor and I arrived early. She made a guess at what she thought it was and gave me my options, biopsy, surgery if it's cancerous etc. Already was told that but ok. I asked for the prices of removal which she then proceeded to give me phone numbers and told me to call them and ask, really they can't even call for me? But ok, let it go. Finally I go to pay, told them I didn't have insurance and would be paying out of pocket, she told me it was 130, I paid and left, nothing else was said. It's been a month and I just got a bill in the mail for 115 dollars from them! They did not once say the appointment was 243 and they'd be splitting it up or absolutely anything of the sort!

864,0,"The food was over-priced, the portions were small and really the food was nothing special. The service was just so-so as the server brought our appetizer after our entree was served. My wife ordered a salad without bacon and they goofed that. After they took it back they returned her a salad that was half of what she was previously served and it appeared they just removed a bunch of food from her plate rather than bringing her a new portion. Very disappointing experience as I paid a lot of money only to go home hungry and dissatisfied. I am certainly not going to go back to this restaurant.",0

Their drink combinations are pretty good. Their food is small portions for the price! Atmosphere is unique and almost every table has a different set of chairs and style which is different. \n\nThe reason I am giving Culinary a terrible review in stars is because my poor boyfriend got food poisoning from the Beef Stroganoff! We came into AZ to re visit my college town and friends and he was out all day saturday, most of sunday, and still not up to par on Monday! I realize this was not their fault that their food was possibly contaminated, however, it was the aftermath that I was unhappy with...\n\nI called the restaurant to talk to the manager....he didnt seem to sympathetic with saying things like \""did he go to the hospital?\"" or \""I served 27 of that dish Saturday Night and I have not had one complaint yet.\"".....definitely not looking for any type of discount but with working in customer service for 10 years that is NOT the way to handle things. He was proceeding to tell me the length of time it can take and how it could have been from something earlier that day or the night before...really?!

The lunch specials are very affordable, even to high school students, and can be packed on days when school lets out early.\n\nAs far as the food goes, everything is delicious.

Even with another 40% off I would not eat there again. I ordered the buttered curry chicken with white rice and naan. My wife got the Mongolian shrimp with noodles. Upon opening my box, I noticed it was only half full. It had grilled chicken on top and some sauce covering the chicken. I was very unimpressed with the portion size for a $10 meal at a take out joint. The sauce was only okay but there was not enough of it to go around. The chicken was good but not anything more. The naan tasted like a spongy piece of blah. My wife's meal had a TON of noodles and very little shrimp. The shrimp were quite tiny and very rubbery.   \n\nSince we got our meals for take out, I decided to call and speak to a manager to inquire about our concerns. The manager tried to tell me that they fill the boxes and the food settles about 1/3 of the way down the box. That's a lot of air in the food!  The manager did not seem to care much about our concerns. No sorry, or please give us another try. She only said she would pass the word along????  I'm not sure what that means, but okay!

I ordered teriyaki chicken, shrimp chow mien, orange chicken, egg rolls and white rice. First red flag was the broken soft drink fountain they had - the lemonade just produced the syrup, no actual lemonade. The orange chicken was obviously stale. The meat was like chewing plastic. The teriyaki chicken was disgusting, how hard is it to at least pour some teriyaki sauce over some grilled chicken, at the least. The sauce they use is a  gravy of some sort, I could honestly place it on top a bed of mashed potatoes. The white rice was hard and must have been a leftover batch from yesterday or hours before. The egg rolls were mediocre, a little greasy but whatever. The only thing that was decent was the shrimp chow mien, there were only 4 or 5 shrimp (large order) but at least the taste was there.

881,0,"My friend who lives in Montreal recommended this secret little gem while we were visiting in the summer. We were looking for French food but less expensive than what your generic google search would spit out. I really gotta give them 5 stars as my experience was impeccable.\n\nThe food was excellent at every point along the way. Several different kinds of locally baked breads and a wide wine selection, along with our waiter who recommended a great wine choice, which made way for several different appetizers for each person's taste. I got the escargots which were far better than ones I had tried previously, made with a simple garlic and butter sauce. Their basic salad with other prix fixe meals was also lovely, and the cheese plate was great as well.\n\nChoosing my actual entree was not as simple. Had I asked more questions, perhaps I would have chosen differently, but one of the specials was locally-sourced crab legs. That I got to crack myself. And wear a bib. In public.\n\nAnyway, goes without saying that it was flawless. The crab was in a classic butter sauce and it matched the other veggies on the dish perfectly. Highly recommended from myself, although they may not have it when not in season.\n\nLastly, as a visitor and English-speaker, being in Montreal is always a little tricky. I speak some French, however I was with my brother and his girlfriend who were not as versed in the menu and style of dining. As rude as some people were in some parts of Quebec, the waitstaff and bartenders at Chez Leveque were very accomodating and really wanted to give us the best experience possible and bridge the language gap.\n\nI really can't say enough great things! I loved it there and it was a very pretty interior. The upstairs is a little more laid back for group events and the bathrooms are modeled after a church. It just works, don't ask me how.",2

On a Friday night I assumed it would be super slammed so I made a reservation just in case. We got there and there were maybe 4 tables filled. It was very quiet, which was nice. \n\nThe service was slow but we honestly didn't mind at all. We took our time and enjoyed ourselves. We started with their complimentary bread basket that was very fresh and delicious then we ordered baked brie for our starter, which how can you go wrong with that? The we ordered two entrees, which included either soup or salad. The salad was average and the clam chowder was overly salty. The shrimp scampi with mushrooms, a side of veggies and pasta was great! Also, we tried the seafood napoli, which was also very good. Both entrees were very large and could easily be split between two people.

887,0,"Note to self: NEVER dine out without first checking Yelp. I had done my research before going to Vegas, but since I was with my daughter and I like to have flexible days, I didn't want every meal planned out and reserved. So we hit a few places based on proximity, hunger factor, and what sounded good. This was one of those MISSES.\n\nOur hotel room TV made Zine sound so fabulous. They really played up the black pepper beef, so that's what I was craving. And my daughter and I love dim sum, so they drew us in with that as well.\n\nWell, there is no dim sum. They've got appetizers that you would see on any Asian restaurant menu. Period. Dim sum? Not really. Ambience was really nice. Service was really good. Food was MEH and it was outrageously expensive. Our meal was $104 and we had no alcohol and we didn't even eat the $30 plate of Walnut Shrimp. Yes, $30 for what you get at any Chinese place. Only this wasn't good and my daughter ate one shrimp and then pushed the plate aside. They really should have comped us.\n\nThe black pepper beef, I will grant them, was super tender. But it was flavorless. Literally. And it was $32!\n\nWe also shared pot stickers (standard) and Vietnamese Egg Rolls that came with a clear sauce that we couldn't figure out if there was any flavor at all. It definitely wasn't fish sauce. I love fish sauce. These rolls were really bland.\n\nSo Let Me Repeat: If you want to throw away your money on bland, overpriced food, this is your place. If you want better food, go to McDonalds. If you want to spend your money on fabulous food, go to Gordon Ramsay Steak or Raku.

These most definitely were crunchy and hot.\n\nAs for cocktails, my girls enjoyed just vodka crans but I tried the Ultimat Dill which has ultimat vodka, agave-lime juice, fresh dill, and cucumber. Well made and very tasty!\n\nLast but not least...\n\nThe ambiance in here was really nice and the place is quite pretty.  Our waiter was so awesome and attentive (and good eye candy too, BONUS!)

897,0,"The first time I sank my teeth into Haji Baba's falafel sandwich, I knew that I had found a winner. Already being a big fan of Phoenecia, I was a little hesitant at first to try Haji Baba, but I had a feeling that I would like it so I gave it a shot. There are three things that you absolutely have to try, and they are:\n\nThe falafel sandwich.\n\nThe gyro plate.\n\nThe dolmas (stuffed grape leaves).\n\nLike most of the reviews read, the falafels are some of the best around! They don't dry out your mouth and are loaded with flavor...not to mention that the sandwich is ultra cheap! As for the gyro plate, I have one thing to say...BEST GYRO MEAT IN PHOENIX! There, I said it. The meat is seriously succulent (you hear that about steak, not gyro meat!), no exaggeration. Just think of the best gyro meat you've ever tasted, but cut thick and served with some of the best tzatziki around. Remember to get the plate when you go and I don't think you will regret it. And lastly, try the dolmas. I say that because they are served here differently than any place in the valley that I've been to, and that is warm. Usually dolmas are served chilled and are brimming with strong sour and oily flavors, not these. Haji Baba's recipe is truly unique; it's mild, not sour and rich with flavor.  Get a small side of lebne to put on em and be prepared for your taste buds to do a little happy dance (not to be confused with the pee pee dance...taste buds don't pee).\n\nThere you have it! I finally, after years of going here, reviewed Haji Baba! Now, take it from me and the abundance of other reviewers and go here.",4

904,0,"I tried this restaurant due to it's proximity to hiking in the Superstitions.  We stopped by after a hike.  The only positive that I have is that the place looks nice and has a nice patio with a waterfall.  I ordered a green chili burro and my wife ordered beef tamales.  Several minutes after I placed my order the waiter came back to tell me they were out of green chili.  No biggie here but at a good restaurant I would expect the waiters to know if they were out of something this basic before the order went in.  \n\nI changed my order to green corn tamales.  When the waiter brought the order out he could not tell which plate had the beef tamales and which were green corn.  He takes the plates away for about 5 minutes to figure it out.  So we were teased with a preview of our meal only to be left hungry for 5 more minutes.  \n\nWhen he brought the plates back we discovered that they were both beef tamales.  I tasted one and it was hard, salty and not at all like any tamale I had ever had.  He took my plate and re-order my tamales.  It took too long for the re-order to come out.  My wife was pretty much finished by the time I got my plate.  She was disappointed in her meal but to starved to hold back from eating it.\n\nMy green corn tamales were better than the beef tamales but not good.  They smothered them with cheese and drenched the plate in a runny sauce.  The rice tasted like rice and tomato sauce and the beans were just straight up nasty.  I could not eat more than one bite.\n\nAs starving as I was from the hike I could not come close to finishing the plate.  I left still hungry.\n\nThe waiter, although friendly, did not offer any amends to the lack of green chili or the tamale mix-up.  \n\nI'll never go back to this place.  Overall this was the worst restaurant experience I have had in a long time.",0

As someone who used to work in the restaurant industry, I am very lenient to servers who may take a long time to get back to the table or who may seem a little stressed. However, Ferdinan at Max Brenner had to be the worst server I have ever had. \n\nI knew we were in for an interesting dining experience when I ordered an IPA and he didn't know what that was. The rest of the meal was filled with awkward comments, and him reading over my friends' shoulders when they were on their phones. At the end of the meal, he did apologize for the bad service and said the restaurant was closing in April, so they were short staffed. Let's just say we were less than shocked. \n\nWhen we left the restaurant, my friend made a comment to the hostesses about the service we had received, and both of them looked at her and simply replied, \""okay.\"" I have never complained to somebody at a restaurant about my service before, but I would expect them to at least express some sort of apology. \n\nAnyways, the food was alright- nothing to write home about.

911,0,Oh the butterburgers and the concretes. Got to love the frozen custard concretes. That you can mix in any two things you want from there list of many. Inside tip: They also have chocolate custard not just vanilla. This I found out after a few visits. I always get chocolate custard with chocolate sauce and Oreo cookies. I think its the best.\nThe burgers are really good. So are the onion rings and the cheese curds. I have never heard of cheese curds before Culvers. Must be a Wisconsin thing but they are really good. To call them fried cheese balls don't do them justice. Just try them. If you like cheese you will like these.\nThe service is pretty good. Sure it takes awhile to get your food but that just means they are making it fresh. For that I am willing to wait. Plus they give you your concrete first so you can enjoy that while you pull forward in the drive thru to wait for the rest of your order. They give you a number and then bring out your food right to your car.\nIt is a little expensive to eat more than once a week but it is well worth it.,3

This was great as it was very very cold outside and the place is tiny so waiting-in wasn't an option. We headed down the street for a drink and ended up missing the call - making our wait a bit longer when we called to check. The owner was GREAT about this - he brought us a round of tequila shots because we waited for a table for over an hour but honestly it was mostly our fault. \n\nMy margarita was awesome and authentic and had fresh coriander. Sorry what?! FRESH CORIANDER. So I was pretty happy about that. I had two.\n\nThe tacos were good. Nothing to write home about.....reasonably priced and unique flavors.\nMy favorites were the carnitas and the squash, black bean and fresh cheese.

When you walk in, to your right you will order at the counter and get a number to put on your table for delivery.  They have booths, a long wooden family style table, chair seating and bar seating.  The pizza special for the day today was an 11\"" white pizza with asparagus, mushrooms, broccoli, ricotta, mozzarella and red pepper flakes.  I ordered the special without mushrooms with a Coke to drink (yay Coke products!) and it was just over $12.  \n\nI love, love, love white pizza.  This, I did not love.  I do not like for the ricotta to be in globs on the pizza, which this was.  It's a personal preference, and not a reflection of a bad tasting pizza.  The crust was thin and crunchy without being hard.  The broccoli was cooked through as was the asparagus.  The red pepper flakes were a little heavy in some places on the pizza, but overall it was well balanced.  \n\nThe wait staff delivers your food and checks a few times to see if you need refills and see if everything is okay.  I found them all to be pleasant and helpful.  A couple of gentlemen, that I believe to be the owners and/or the chef(s) after seeing their webpage, were walking around the restaurant checking on people as well.  I did like that the restaurant seemed to be kid/family friendly without catering specifically to children, thus alienating those of us who don't want to listen to some guy making balloon animals while trying to eat.  \n\nThe execution of the pizza was fine, I just didn't particularly care for this pizza.

Taylor's is a fun place to go for that New England seafood house experience in the Phoenix area.\n\nI always order a bowl of chowder which is just okay.  Creamy with plenty of clams and potatoes but has a strange flavor ingredient that I can't quite place which makes it taste just a bit off.  A small dollop of butter stirred in makes it taste more authentic.\n\nThis is one of very few places in the area where you can get fried scallops that come out tasting how they should and remind me of being back in Massachusetts.  Very large and fresh with a light batter and fried golden brown - delicious.\n\nI know this place has been around forever and it shows.  It really reflects a bit negatively when the decor in the restaurant is fun and authentic, but covered in dust and cobwebs.  The owner really just needs to shut down for a week and pull everything out and re-do it with the same theme but updated.  It would really really improve the experience!\n\nMy other reason besides the chowder and decor that garnered only 3 stars is the fact that they won't take AMEX cards.  I know many smaller places don't but it is really a pain when you are traveling and cannot use a corporate card to pay for meals and need to use either a personal card or cash to pay.\n\nIf the owners of Taylor's read this review and fix these things I guarantee they would begin getting 5 star ratings across the board!",2

I later spotted it in the all intising window, along with the rest of the good stuff that the guy refuses to sell with a whopping \u00a345 price tag.\n\nAvoid this place, its all junk anyway.",0
941,0,"3 1/2 stars. Located in the same strip center as Raku and Monta Ramen I arrived for lunch and was surprised how small but cute the place is. There was only one other patron besides myself. \n\nMy order the pork cutlet curry. My dish arrived promptly and the curry sauce was flavorful but I added medium spicy seasoning for additional spiciness. I thought the pork was on the tough side and was a little difficult to even cut. \n\nI thought Japanese Curry Zen was pretty average and prefer Coco Ichiban due to they have a larger variety and offer combinations.\n\nDon't get me wrong, if I'm craving Japanese Curry in LV I would return to Japanese Curry Zen.",0
942,0,Cool restaurant great neighborhood concept but the food is so bland. Store bought chips for the dips. Kids Mac and cheese is gritty and flavorless. Chicken in salad is over cooked and not seasoned. Heaping pile of raw arugula on my pizza. Salt is great resource. Thanks but no thanks not again,0
943,0,This was the first place we stopped in Vegas after we left the airport! Hands down the best burger I ever had in my life! Sorry I forget what the name of it was. But it had an egg on it! The flavor that this burger had was insane! And the perfect squishy fresh roll that housed it was awesome! We also got the Bah mi burger. The flavors in this burger were so intense! It was full of flavor and both were cooked a perfect medium. We also got the fries with pineapple ketchup which were hot and crisp! Also got the belly buns which were fresh and delicious!  The chicken strips were to die for for as well! When I'm in the area again ill def be coming back here!,4

948,0,"A completely avoidable 3 HOUR tarmac delay in a frozen cabin!  NEVER flying US airways again.\n\nMy connecting flight from PHX to OAK came to the gate with a known major technical issue in the cockpit which would prevent proper pre-flight checks.\n\nThey boarded us anyway rather than provide a different plane. As one of the first people on board I saw 3 maintenance staff already present on the aircraft.\n\nWe received no status and upon inquiry (after 45 minutes with no action), they \""claimed\"" it was the first officer's seat-belt that needed replacement.   Seat belts don't take 3 hours to replace, nor do they require 4 levels of maintenance staff.  They had us sit there in a plane cold enough to ship freshly packed meat for 3 freaking hours.\n\nBy the time we took off I had developed a 103 fever.  I should sue them on behalf of my company, as I'll probably be down for the rest of the week trying to recover.\n\nThey also violated FAA/DOT rules regarding provision of adequate food/hydration, and after something so egregious, they offered nothing in compensation.",0
949,0,"I've been to this location a few times now, and I guess it's time for me to write a review of this place.  Honestly, of all the grocery stores big and small here in the Valley, Trader Joes is probably my least favorite.  Over the years, I've tried to like them..trust me, I've TRIED. I just can't get into the Trader Joe's scene.\n\nIt's not one particular thing that turns me off about Trader Joe's, but maybe its a variety of small things that irk me. For starters, I find thier food selection odd.  Mostly prepackaged stuff, with no deli, meat counter,  and very little name brand stuff.  I know I know, I don't need to buy every single thing name brand, but there are some things name brand that I prefer over others.  Plus, when I buy lunch meat, I want to go to a Deli Counter and get it, which they do not have.  Just prepackaged meats n cheeses.\n\nI tend to buy mostly sandwiches here during lunch hour.  Their fair priced, and right there.  The first few times I went here, I was getting a Tuna Sandwich on whitebread.  I liked it, and started buying it on a regular basis.  Then, they stopped making it.  Why?  I dunno, but I haven't seen it in like 3 weeks.  Just when I start liking something, it vanishes.  Now all they have are tuna wraps, but they arent as good as the sandwiches.\n\nAs for grocery shopping on a weekly basis, I will probably never be a regular here.  The reason I frequent this Trader Joe's is because its A) close to my office, B) there's a decent sandwhich selection readily available, and C) thier staff is always friendly and helpful.",2

After much searching, they had the cheapest price for the combined airfare and  motel  stay.   Here is a list of things that  really did not set well with me. \n1)  The check in process.  After  dealing with more than 7 hours of  traveling,  we had to stand in line for more than an hour to get checked into the room.   Part of the issue was  they only had  3 - 5 people checking in guest and they had way more computers than that and they were just not used.  \n2)  Everything in the room is extra;  refrigerator,  microwave.  \n3)  House keeping was terrible.  After our first night the next day we showered and went on the strip.  They did not clean our room,  we had to call and have  housekeeping  bring us fresh towels and  pick up our trash.   The 2nd day,  we were scheduled for  the Celine Dion  Show and had to go without showering because you guessed it  no house keeping service.  We called and requested towels and was told that we were priority, and after waiting an hour,  no  one showed up.  \n4)  Resort fee is extra 18.00 a day after booking fees are paid.",0
957,0,"Family of 4 went there for dinner tonight. Staff was friendly and the food came out pretty quickly even though they were very busy.

We also tried the carne asana nachos, which were excellent. The chips were homemade and very good. All in all a good experience and we'll be back. Only complaint I had, which is not at all the owners fault, was the family with 5 kids too many. If you're going to take your family out to dinner and bring your small children be courteous of those around you. Parents were too busy talking to each other to notice their kids running around screaming in the restaurant. So rude! If you can't control your children in a public place, stay home!!",3

The food was what I had remembered - really impeccable and created with such skill. Everything on the menu is good. My group really enjoyed their dishes and the ambiance (lively without the overkill of music - we could hear each other talk).

Perfectly rich and creamy!! If you're a chocolate lover...you will not be disappointed with chocolate mousse!!!! Warning...will induce foodgasms!!! ;D\n\nOverall...even though Bouchon has multiple locations and a commercialized chef (still very respected)...the food at this Vegas location is Fantastic!!!

969,0,We had been told by a few people to go here and get our mattresses. I had called the store and had gotten a quote for a set and then sent my husband in to look at it. A couple weeks went by and a living social deal popped up $39 for a $200 voucher.  It sounded to good to be true-right? Well it was! I purchased the voucher and headed over a couple days later to get a bed.  When I got there the sales guy told me that he already reduced all the beds $200 ( voucher-can't be used with any other sales) and that basically the living social deal is no good. Hmmmm that sounded a little unethical to me. He basically went into a contract with living social and then turned around and said he reduced everything so therefore the voucher is void! The funny thing is he quoted me prices weeks before the living social deal and had NOT changed his pricing from then????\nDon't get me wrong his prices are decent I just wasn't impressed on the fact that he did the living social deal just to get people in the door.  I went home and contacted living social and they refunded my $$$ and said that if this is what he did then he broke his contract with them and these are not the businesses they want to work with.  Again decent prices just didn't like how this deal was handled.,0

I felt lucky at first arriving at a nonbusy time. Little did I know it would take them a whole hour just to get my car keys back so the guys could work on my car! It was like dealing with dumb and dumber! Neither of them knew what they were doing. They were confusing each other and talking crap about the work issues they have there. They kept telling me I had the wrong battery size and had to do an exchange now which requires a manager. The manager had zero personality. Seemed like nothing in their computers were working right. The guy had to scan my car battery at least 6xs. They said the battery they gave me was larger but said I wouldn't need to pay a difference. In all their confusion the cashier guy handed me $12... I'm pretty sure I was not due credit.. Ugh! Last time here!,0

973,0,"This place is just OK. The bartender walked by to-be-orderers several times before noticing them. Drinks were sufficiently stiff. The food was hit and miss. \n\nNachos - cheese sauce (come on, we're in WI!) and very little cheese. The meat on top was dry, almost like jerkey. It must have gone on before it was broiled, or it sat under the heat lamp for too long. It should have not been served; it clearly looked dry. \n\nChicken Tenders - overall quite good. Good but probably not home made BBQ sauce. Fries were just OK. \n\nCheese Curds - very good, but not the best in town. Although unusual, the dipping sauce was an interesting change of pace. I think it was ranch dressing mixed with Franks Red Hot.  \n\nWe got a goodie bag of free baked goods just before we left, which was a nice touch and a creative way of marketing. \n\nI am tempted to take off another star because stakeholders in the business clearly wrote their own 5-star reviews (that were filtered out by yelp)",1
974,0,"Living in Las Vegas I have tried a number of AYCE Sushi places and would definately recommend this restaurant. There is a wide selection of rolls and the ones I and a friend tried were tasty, especially the Lobster Crunch roll. Yes, they can over do the Ponzu sauce a bit so you might ask for your rolls without or very light on the sauce. The rolls are big and there are no half orders (I didn't see this as an option at least) so order what you are going to eat. Also a great selection of items on the menu aside from Sushi. The grilled pork belly was very good and served sizzling on a hot platter. I also enjoyed the Tempura Calamari. Served as strips and not over done and chewy as rings tend to be.\n\nWe went on a week night, not crowded and we sat at the Sushi bar. The chefs and wait staff  were friendly but I can see it might get hectic if the place is full since they were light on wait staff.  So get your initial order in and then when you are looking to order more don't think about 1 item at a time. For the AYCE they give you 1 1/2 hours which should be more than enough time to satisfy your Sushi fix. \n\nThey have specials written up on the board that are not part of the AYCE, so be aware of that. But I recommend you try Umiya and make your own decision. I know I will be back.",4

The first time I was 2 minutes late to order the sandwich, of course I waited in line for 15 minutes before having the opportunity to order.  The second time I waited for more than 10 minutes just to order their green tea, which turned out to be horrible.  The third time my husband and I made a morning trip so that I could order the breakfast sandwich.  What a waste of time and money.  The real sandwich does not look at all like the picture and we were extremely disappointed in the quality.

No culinary delights, just decent tastes with decent portions.\n\nI noticed that they recently dropped their prices, maybe in response to the feedback here.

981,0,"After all the Yelp hype and personal recommendations, I was so disappointed to discover that Gibby's did not live up to either.  I went a couple of months ago for a work trip with 4 other people from my company, 3 of which were of the same opinion as myself about the food.  \n\nWe started with the salad with Gibby's signature dressing.  I will pat Gibby's on the back for their AMAZING homemade salad dressing... I tried to buy a bottle or two, but they were repackaging it and didn't have any on hand at the time.  I'm sorry to say the salad dressing was the highlight of the evening and things went south from there.\n\nMy coworker and I ordered the beef wellington next.  I have never tasted a more bland and utterly inedible piece of meat in my life... my coworker felt the same.  I wouldn't have taken a second bite if my boss wasn't paying $50 for the thing.  It tasted like it was barely sprinkled with salt - no other marination whatsoever.  The accompanying mushroom gravy, A1, and Worcestershire didn't help either.  I couldn't imagine how much worse it could taste reheated, so I most certainly did not take the rest to go.\n\nAnother coworker who ordered the rib eye steak was also not impressed, even after dousing it in the sauces mentioned above.  Another coworker order the fish course, which she was not fond of either.  Our team is from Texas and we've had some truly great steaks there for half the cost of Gibby's.  \n\nThe service, however, was excellent.

983,0,"I love the Cosmopolitan!  Every facet of the place exudes cool, class, elegance, and sexiness.  The guest rooms are among the nicest, most modern, and well appointed to be found in Vegas.  The restaurants are first-rate.  The Vesper, the Chandelier, and Bond are exemplary bars manned by friendly, extremely skilled bartenders crafting some truly inspired cocktails which are the best on the Strip.  There are plenty of blackjack and craps tables.  The dealers are personable and professional.  The cocktail waitresses taking care of gamblers are attractive and attentive.  The resort staff, from the reps at the registration desk to housekeeping, is professional and proficient.  The Cosmopolitan would be my first choice to stay and play every time I'm in Vegas.\n\nSo, you may ask, why the 1-star review?  Carol W and I went to Vegas for Thanksgiving staying from Mon to Sat.  Our respective families joined us there and were also staying at the Cosmo.  Midweek stays tend to be less busy in Vegas and the week of Thanksgiving is an extremely low period for Vegas tourism.  As such, I called to speak to a casino host to see if I could get a better room rate than was being offered online on the Cosmo website or through Expedia/Travelocity/Orbitz/etc.  We do the overwhelming majority of our gambling as well as eating and drinking at the place we stay in Vegas.  The host I spoke with (who shall remain nameless) offered to COMP our stay...NOT simply offer us the casino rate for the room, which was $150/night Mon-Thurs and $245 for Fri night for our Terrace Studio room.  I fully understood that this comped room would require me to gamble at a certain level of play throughout our stay (although the host did not state what this amount would be).  While I had multiple offers from other Vegas properties for comped or deeply discounted rates (much deeper than the Cosmo's rate), we decided to stay at the Cosmopolitan.  However upon our arrival, we discovered our room was being charged at the casino rate NOT comped.  I attempted to contact the host that I'd spoken to on multiple occasions without success to get the discrepancy resolved.  At the end of our stay when it came time for us to checkout, I was told that the host would review my play and comp me accordingly, crediting it back to my credit card, if I'd earned it.  This was NOT the agreed upon arrangement that I thought we'd made prior to deciding to stay at the Cosmo.  Next time (not that the Cosmo will see a next time from me), I'll get it in writing.  The total amount for our stay ($966), while not inexpensive, certainly was manageable. \n\nI'm not a high roller; I never claimed to be one!  I never asked to be comped for our entire stay.  If you couldn't comp my entire stay since I hadn't established a history of play at your property, then you should've said so before I committed to staying at your property.  If you could only offer me the casino rate, then you should've said so before I committed to staying at your property.  I would've stayed somewhere else and saved myself the money I spent for a room that I spent very little time in!  However, most important to me, it's simply a matter of principle.  If you make me an offer to comp my stay, you should live up to it.  We both know that you would've made your money back from me and then some!  Your actions showed me how much you value my business.  \n\nI'm not holding my breath expecting to get any part of my stay credited back to me.  Cosmopolitan, even though I do love you, I do know how to quit you.  You'll never see me in one of your guest rooms or at one of your tables or machines again.  It's a matter of principle.",3

It was all peppers swimming in oil with a side of rice.  My husband ordered the chicken marinated in yogurt and orange sauce.  His came and was a piece of chicken on a dish, didn't taste like anything at all, just grilled chicken.

I'm only giving The Mission 3.5 stars because I thought the food was more beautiful than delicious.  My dad had the pork which was cooked appropriately for medium rare, but was a bit on the bland side.  I had the butternut squash tacos which looked wonderful--extremely colorful, but were also on the bland side in spite of the fresh lime wedges and slices of red chili (these tacos were also a bit pricey, $12 for 3 and the tortillas were the size of small sugar cookies).  My husband did seem satisfied with his hanger steak tacos.  Even though we planned on getting dessert, the consensus was that our dinner hadn't been particularly impressive so we opted to go elsewhere.\nThere are a lot of rave reviews on yelp for the guacamole.  It was good, but not phenomenal and, at $12, it tied for the most expensive guacamole I've ever had (tie with a Mexican restaurant in NYC).",0

I also ordered a side of the mash potatoes which were also amazing. \n\nMy husband and a friend we were with did not enjoy themselves like I did though. My husband ordered the shepherds pie, it was his dream to taste Ramsey's twist on it.  Unfortunately he was extremely disappointed, his meal came out (we ordered two at our table) more like a soup. It was extremely watery at the bottom, embarrassed to complain at Gordon Ramsays restaurant my husband just stared at his food. I finically built up the courage to tell the waiter we were unhappy with his meal... It was returned and made again (which was better then the first).

I was determined to try it even though it was 8:30pm & we had a 5 hour drive ahead of us. I mean, doesn't having a yummy snack make long drives better?\n\nThe workers here are SOOO incredibly nice, practically forcing us to have free samples before we chose to buy anything. They always have 3 flavors fresh in stock & a bunch of rock hard frozen flavors in the freezer. \n\nWe had a scoop of vanilla custard ($2.22) & a chocolate concrete w/ Kit Kat mixed in ($4.90). Between the 3 of us, we couldn't even finish because the custard was so creamy & thick & the servings were so large. The ever-so-friendly workers even gave us a little extra custard in our concrete so that it was oozing over the edge.\n\nI can only describe it as a creamier version of ice cream w/o all the extra ice fluff & a thicker version of frozen yogurt. Whatever this magical mixture is, it's heavenly!\n\nFrozen custard was even voted as on of the \""top 100 things to eat.\"" You'd be a fool not to try it!",4

It was definitely a great price for a large group since we visited during happy hour and took advantage of Buy 1 Get 1 Free of anything on the menu.\n\nI do have to say that the best part was the sangria and the cheesecake we brought with us. The atmosphere is good but it is somewhat small in size.\nThe best tapas were the: manchego (you can't go wrong obviously), the shrimp, the meatballs and the chicken pieces. Our server suggested the ham and cheese croquettes which had neither ham nor cheese but potatoes instead. He was sure they were ham and cheese but the whole table wasn't convinced. The paella was good although the rice was a little overcooked in spots and our friend found a completely undercooked piece of chicken. We did send it back and they promptly brought us another portion. The dish was good but that was a little unnerving.\nI'm open to second chances and will probably give this a second chance just based on the sangria, the large menu  and the amazing happy hour deal!",2

996,0,What an eclectic menu for a diner!  The ambiance is just what you would expect from a classic 60's diner.  I had a ruben and some fries and it was really good!  Most places use processed corned beef.  Theirs was real sliced beef...very tender and very flavorful.  Probably the best ruben I have ever had.  I had to try the pie too since they tease you with a great display right when you walk in.  The French silk was really rich and chocolaty.  Definately worth the stop if you are in the area or passing through.,3

Plus it came highly recommended from a few co-workers so we decided to try it. We had 6 pm reservations. When we checked in, we were immediately seated. The ambiance was elegant and quiet, perfect for a fancy dinner. We decided we weren't going to stuff our faces too much so we skipped the appetizers. I ordered the surf & turf with scallops and an 8 oz filet mignon. The steak was perfectly cooked and so tender but still retains its \""beefiness.\"" The scallops were exceptional. Not over cooked and served with a lemon butter sauce. My friend and I split a side of risotto. I still dream of that risotto. Very rich and heavy with peas and prosciutto. Part of me wanted to stop eating my streak and just eat the risotto. \n\nService here was excellent as you would expect from Mr. Colicchio. And the other thing worth raving about is the bread! Salty, sweet, bread. This restaurant far exceeded my expectations.",3

We had the Korean Bulgogi Steak Tacos that definitely brought some heat with the red peppers and tang via the marinade.  The Teriyaki Chicken Taco's were flavorful, but the safe option to choose.  Lastly, we split the Thai coconut Chicken Taco's and they were exceptional!  Overall the tacos were seasoned well and juicy, but had more vegetables as filler at the forefront than meat.      \n\nThe guys running the truck were nice and efficient and I would definitely go back if I ever crossed paths with 'em in NoDa again.",3

Used the Valet (and they were quick and very affable...even give you bottles of water before you get in your car), which turns out to be about $5 bucks a day..totally worth it!\n\nFrom the Valets to the Front Desk to the Dealers to the Waitresses and just the whole staff....service was very friendly and very good.  I don't understand the other reviewers negatives on this?  Compared to the Strip hotels (where there's attitude), it's night and day!\n\nRooms were great....Big, comfy, and well-appointed (could've used a Coffee Maker and a Full-Sized Ironing Board).  Bed was comfy too and Bathrooms were great!\n\nWe had a Strip/Pool View on the 7th floor.......fantastic!  Pool is great, and uncrowded.  \n\nWine bar is great, Marinelli's was a tad pricey but very good (best bread I've ever had), Buffet great...etc, etc!\n\nThe whole vibe was relaxing, unhurried, uncrowded and very nice... unlike the Strip.  Free of the tackiness of the Strip!  Great, wide-open Casino floor, Poker room, and Cocktail waitresses (think fake boobs could be an employment requirement, but no complaints?...lol).\n\nThe good thing was that with the Rental car, was able to go to the Strip one night, park at the Venetian (ate at the Grand Luxe) and then was able to leave, when we were ready....It was so easy.\n\nThen with the car, we went to the Red Rock (which was also great), shopped over there, went and saw Green Valley Ranch, Town Square and other parts of Vegas you'd never see by being locked in to the Strip.  \n\nCan go on and on, but think you get the picture?  Rent a car (they're cheap in Vegas), stay at the M and you're free to do whatever you want, when you want and then come back to the very comfortable enviorns of the M....You'll thank me later!",4
1002,0,"$40 was steep for our lunch as we awaited our suite to be ready. Killed some time here and was rather surprised by how good the chopped salad was!!!!! So, so good, with uber fresh ingredients, like celery, fresh peas, lettuce, bright and flavorful!!! There was chicken, and some fresh herbs, and at least 4 other ingredients. loved the light dressing as well. Fresh taco-like shell that has the texture of Chinese shrimp chips, with sesame seeds embedded in it. Salad was about $16\n\nDisappointing was a $4 cup of nasty, non crispy, flabby fries that accompanied a French size grilled Mahi Mahi sandwich in chipotle sauce. Good, but def not worth $17.\n\nHey, it's Vegas, y'know?\n\nGet that salad. AMAZING AMAZING\nSet along the side of the Wynn pool.",4

If I am paying $14 for a sushi roll and $25 for  a dinner plate I want date night worthy.  What I got was Denny's worthy.  It's cheap, it's boring, and there were kids crying at the table next to us the entire time.  I asked about switching up a roll and was told changing spicy salmon into spicy crab in a sushi roll would incur a $2 charge.  I said nevermind and went with the roll as is.  The waiter was attentive and just the right amount of presence, always a plus, and other than the decor and the weird upcharge I LOVED my food.  Edamame was perfectly steamed, the sushi was ohsogood.  My husband ordered the hibachi which was sooooo bland.  I don't think they used any salt or pepper in the cooking process.  There were three small pieces of shrimp, a tiny handful of veggies, loads of noodles and rice, and a good portion of steak(which was very tender, but unflavored) and chicken which was overcooked.\n\nAll in all the sushi is worth going back for, but I won't be trying their Hibachi nor will I be staying around.  Take-out is where it's at.",0

The club felt like a cheesy version of Vegas and everything was totally overpriced. If not for the good company of friends, I would've peaced out to a more comfortable club.\n\nWhat bothers me most about this club is the entire attitude. On their Facebook page they happily say Scottsdale is \""going downhill\"" and credit themselves with bringing them out of it by having a retarded dress code. They think the \""upper class\"" should remain the upper class. Right, you charge $10 for a cover in Arizona. Go to LA where they charge $45 or more for a mediocre club and get back to me about that upper class. \n\n\nOnly pros - the bathroom was interesting. Bizarre really.

While being a Total Rewards Member I was able to receive my 1 room comp'd for 3 days  4nights while the other was at reduced prices for the duration of our family trip.  \n\nFrom the lack of in-room menu, lack of cleanliness of public common areas, and hell even my room's plumbing there were problems all over the place.  But I am mindful that this place is under renovation, so I'm hoping all these problems will be fixed with the completion of that process. \n\nThe Ginseng3 restaurant as well as Hash House A Go Go are great draws to this property as well as the gaming with very entertaining and helpful staff.  Why over the duration of the weekend I was able to upgrade my gold card to platinum status on property so that was pretty awesome.\n\nOverall this place is going through some growing pains, and really you're in Vegas on the strip at discounted prices.  Manage your expectations and enjoy your accommodations because you already know what you're getting yourself into.\n\n*Side note if you have any problems with your experience MAKE SURE TO VOICE THEM to a general manager of any sort then a few days after your stay to fill out the survey they send you!  After I told them of the problem with the plumbing in my room in the survey, I received 3 emails with personalized apologies for their short falls and even 1 phone call where the manager again apologized and comp'd an extra night saving us even more money.

The Double Frrrozen Hot Chocolate is delish, and so refreshing on a hot day in Vegas!

The weirdest thing was the very last bite tasted the best. It's like I'm emotionally attached to that last bite and how it made me feel. YUM!!!\n\nI hate the Sonny Boy but I'm not an olive person. Every bite was overwhelming with an olive taste. YUCK!!!\n\nI could of done without the 2 and half hour wait though. Since there is a wait, people get super drunk. When you're sober and everyone around you is drunk, it can be a tad bit annoying and loud. The restaurant is super small. There is no room to really have an intimate experience when people are yelling in your ear.\n\nAlso, I could care less for the service. I guess when you're not hurting for business you could act however you want. I totally don't agree with that statement. I hope the staff reads these yelp reviews and improves the service. Eventually, the bad service will outweigh the taste of the food. Then people will stop coming.\n\nIf I ever had the chance to come back, I would probably order takeout. The website said you couldn't but I saw someone who did. It also said they validate, and they do but it doesn't cover the whole parking fee.\n\nOverall, I'm still happy that I got to experience the BEST PIZZA for myself.

We saw you could buy a 6 pack for $8 which is a killer deal. We got Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and cracked one open. It had gone bad. We asked to change it out for Alaskan Amber. That had gone bad too. We ended up throwing the 6 pack away, which I don't do. The pizza was not square as they boast but round. And it looks nothing like the photos on the outside of the building or on their website. Small and scarce pepperoni with a cracker thin crust. Tasted like the pizza you get at an arcade or a bowling alley. My guess is it was frozen.

1023,0,"I'm not really happy with JT's. Missouri mud and Colorado's rocks and snow left my expensive mountain bike a bit of a mess. Also the tires it had just don't hold up well to the thorns and sharp rocks of the Mojave desert so it was time to find a local bike shop that could make things better. I picked JT's based on their location off I-515 at Horizon Drive in Henderson and the fact that they offer extended evening hours on Thu and Fri were a plus. \n\nI dropped my bike off on a Sunday and as they looked it over they recommended new tires right off the bat. The new Kenda tires are good, but it took JT's 4 days to get them in from their vendor which in this day and age seems a bit excessive. When I walked in to pick up my bike they went out the back door and wheeled it in...and this seriously freaked me out. While I've had the bike a few years it was a $3000 bike back then, and it's still got value now and it was left chained up outside? Yeah, not happy about that at all. After paying for the service work I loaded up the bike and headed home wondering how the bike would ride....\n\nSunday afternoon before sunset I took it over to the River Mountain Loop Trail to find out. And to be honest I am not happy. It has a new chain but it doesn't shift right. I was told my top of the line Shimano rear cassette was going to need replaced in a year or so. To be honest this is not my primary bike and it hasn't been ridden all that much. If it's got 250 miles on it I'd be shocked and most of that would be on Katy Trail riding in Missouri or some short stints up in the Colorado Rockies on slow downhill single track descents while stopping to snap pix with a camera in hand. So from the diminished ride quality to being told I may need to upgrade the rear cassette and that my brake pads would need replaced soon...again considering the usage I'm thinking I might want to find another local bike shop for the next time I need service. Specialized doesn't build junk, I didn't buy junk, at the time this was their top of the line, and for it to allegedly need all this service? Yeah...right. And quite frankly my bike still isn't where I would feel comfortable getting it out and going for a long ride. I'm just not happy with it. And with the money I spent...yeah, I'm beginning to think I might have got screwed and not in a good way either. \n\nOh and it clicks under load now where it never did before.

Don't eat here and not get these. A homemade donut, coated in graham cracker with gooey marshmallow inside with dark chocolate dipping sauce.

He challenged me, by letting me know that they have fresh mint and it is capable.\n\nWell, I got my 'mojito'. \nMakes me wonder if the bartender was telling me she couldn't make it because of the mint.... or that she COULDN'T make it...... because...... gag.\n\nLast June, I set up a birthday of about 16 for my husband's birthday. I made a reservation at least a week in advance. Waiter / busser would throw the bag of bread on the table, and then hide. They could barely be found. Had to beg for refills.\n\n\nWe have had one great waiter in the 3 years we have been eating there, and that is only because I took my pregnant self and spoke to the manager and complained hardcore. He told me to make a reservation with him, he comp'd our meal, and I'm sure that is why we were treated so nice.",0

They had an epic sale when they decided to get rid of all of their men's clothing and I was able to get some good shirts for cheap.\n\nI like the way it's laid out inside and everyone was nice.",3

1033,0,"I eat at cafe rio at least once a week. Not once has it crossed my mind to write a review because the food speaks for it's self. Unfortunately I had a horrible experience with the cashier at this location so I felt the need to write a review. The line was extremely long and not to order your food, to pay. Might want to look into hiring competent workers, who actually want to work and not gossip while the line backs up.",0
1034,0,"Enjoyed our one night stay while in Scottsdale the night before we attended Eagles game at Cardinal stadium. Great location, spacious rooms, good breakfast and friendly helpful staff. My only complaint was the coffee was weak, almost like dirty water.",3
1035,0,"We've never been here when there is much life in this place, but i still kind of like it. Whenever we are there, it feels more like a hangout for a few folks to have a drink at the bar, but they have ample space to be a full-fledged restaurant. The most spacious, spread out dining area in Belmont it seems. i just need to go at a better time when there is a crowd here (assuming that time exist) to get a true feel for them. There are a few paintings on the wall that contrast the drab overall feel at night. \n\nWe have enjoyed their Chicken Jalapeno Dip twice now. Pretty tasty and pretty filling for two people. We split that with an entree and left full. \n\nTheir Facebook page said something about a new tv and game room, it must have been in the back because we were watching sports on an antique television over the bar. They did have $1 Budweiser cans when we were there and Southern Tier on draft. Seems to be something on special most days.",2
1036,0,"Pretty good but nothing special. Definitely better than IHOP or Denny's, though. Have a few interesting omelettes and scrambles but nothign to really write home about. Would go again if I'm in the area and looking for breakfast but not making a special trip.",3
1037,0,"This store is a great idea.  It's large, has a wide vareity of items and lots of staff willing to help you.  I feel like it is the kind of place where if you are willing to become a frequent flier and figure out which days are the best shopping days, you will be able to find find some winners.  You will have to work for it though.  \n\nI'm not an avid thrifter, but the prices did seem a little high to me.  I realize the money is going to a good cause, but I was quite surprised by the price points.  While most of the items were in fairly good condition, I did open up a dresser and all the drawers were full of cat hair.  Yuck.  I mean I realize the stuff is used, but a little cleaning goes a long way when you are charging top dollar for used items.",0
1038,0,"I went in today to have a look at their selection, i walked in and no one was there. I heard someone snoring in the back so i figured i would take a peek. As i thought, someone was laying on the couch sleeping! ahah. I hate waking people up so I took a few business cards, took note of their products, and went on my way.\n\nProducts were some of what i am looking for, drip tips, and batteries, and also looking for new brands of liquid i haven't tried out. I'll be back in a few days maybe, and hopefully someone will be awake to answer a few of my questions.\n\nIt's a small store from what i saw, i didn't see any testers i could help myself to, i did see a showcase full of flavors which was nice. I did find a couple that caught my eye as i was reading them. Other than that, it was a shame i walked in at a bad time.\n\nfor now 2/5 stars i can't leave this mistake unsaid.",0
1039,0,I raised my rating to four stars due to I returned for lunch today. The restaurant is close to where our conference was being held and was squeezed on time. I tried the lunch special - a bowl of curry on rice and a bowl of pork ramen with miso broth. Food tasted better today and was less salty.(Maybe because I drank last night?) The portion of ramen was still quite large and curry was very tasty for a bargain price of $12.95 including tip.,3
1040,0,"Would not recommend this place  to anyone seeking good seafood. We started with crab cakes that were sub par. My husband's steak and prawns were weak. The steak was not sirloin quality and the shrimp smelled and tasted badly. The manager was kind enough to knock off about $8 for his meal, but the plate was so bad the entire entree should have been deducted. \nMy snow crab legs were good, but the side veggies were not. They had a strange lemon flavor which doesn't normally accompany green beans and zucchini - which was over cooked. Squishy zucchini is never good. \nOverall our only positives were the side salads. \nThe restaurant itself is also very dark, the lights never seemed to get brighter. Our server was pleasant but very slow. The place was not that busy so we are still not sure what took so long for the food and check to arrive. We won't be returning.",0
1041,0,"Thankfully I only stayed one night there and after arriving and waiting in line to check-in for almost 40 minutes, directions to our rooms were given to us. Directions that lead us to no results since we got lost. The layout of the casino and hotel is extremely confusing and is not intuitive at all. \n\nFinally we made it to our room and noticed a weird smell in the air. Not that of dead prostitute or cold tobacco thankfully, but it was rather funky and we had to crack the window open to freshen things up.\n\nThe room was decent but far from great. It was clean at least but the beds were a bit soft. The internet wasn't complimentary either and was something like $8 per device which I thought was rather expensive, especially in this day and age; at least it was fast.\n\nAlthough I'm sure that Circus Circus, at some point in time, might have been a nice play to stay at, it seems very beaten up and is now just a tacky, worn out and in dire need of rejuvenation kind-of-place. It's pretty bad in there and almost creepy. Looks like it hasn't been touched since the 70s or something and the casino floor is another great display of where I would not want to spend a dime. It smells bad and the croupiers are creepy looking.\n\nThere's a Krispy Kreme donut shop and a few shops on the lower floor and they have an entire part of the building that's under a giant, ugly purple down known as the \""Adventuredome\"" where there's some kind of theme park. It was closed when I tried to scout it out, possibly because it was past 10PM. It didn't look all that great.\n\nAs far as food options go, there's very little that they offer .There's a buffet but it looked terrible. We settled for Rock & Rita's for our breakfast and it was not all that great. There's a few bars but most of them are lame and past their prime as you'll be able to tell when walking around the place for over an hour around 10:30PM-ish.\n\nIn many ways, this place could be used a set for a sequel to Steven King's \""IT\"" movies or something. It's definitely creepy enough. Maybe they should just blow it up and build something else there. It might actually improve the value of the land and Circus Circus seems to be past it's prime... Way past it.\n\nI doub that I'd ever want to stay there again. There's many better options and most have a better location since Circus Circus is at the very beginning of the strip.",0
1042,0,"Jollibee oh so popular because it's big in the Philippines. Many people eat this because it is a fast food place that's affordable. You get what you pay for. The only reason I can give this place three stars is because their Filipino spaghetti is very Filipino original with the chopped hotdogs. If you want good chicken, I'd say there are a lot of other options out for you. If you want the Filipino atmosphere with plenty of chismis and people staring at you, then this is your spot. I also like the fact that the Filipino channel is on all the time.",2
1043,0,"There is not much to say that hasn't already been said about this place. It is one of the better pizzerias in the Mesa. \n\nI have gone here quite a few times, usually stopping in for a slice. These slices are amazing! Some of the biggest single pizza slices that I have ever seen and not very expensive at all. They normally load on the toppings pretty well, not skimping nor overloading, but when you just buy a slice, toppings never stick onto the pizza, and here they seems to just sadly lay on top of a delicious slice. It is much better to just stick with a basic one if you want a slice and something crazier if you get a whole pizza. \n\nOne sad part is they have some of the smallest wings I have ever seen. I am not the most knowledgeable when it comes to wings, but I have had my fair share and these were by far the smallest wings I have ever eaten. Not sure if they were just from the runt chickens of the pack or something. I've actually tried them on multiple times, thinking I may have had bad luck the first time, but again, I thought they were below-average on their size. Sad, since the barbecue sauce was DELICIOUS!\n\nA good place with some pretty decent lunch and daily deals.",2

The hot and sour soup intantly became greatness to me.\n\nService- I guess i went at a weird time as I was the only one in the place , so every thing came out fast and hot.But you can tell the server was about to leave and kept rushing away to do her final things.:(\n\nThe Get up- kinda standard look to the place , blacks and red stark asain decor . nothing new or stand out. but not cheesy either.\n\nAll in all, ill go again but probably wont suggest it when headed out with friends.",2

1049,0,"Despite living near this place and often seeing their ads, I just recently tried it.  I have always been leary of chain massage places after hearing stories of pushy up sells for memberships that override the importance of the actual massage.  At a recent Yelp event, my wife won a gift card for a 50 minute relaxation gift card.  She gave the gift card to me since she has yet to use a massage gift card I gave to her for another place.  Apart from fearing the chain massage locations, I have almost always received awesome massages from independent therapists and local massage businesses which is another reason I was hesitant to try this place.  \n\nHand and Stone is a nice place.  The lobby is mostly inviting and relaxing, but the placement of products for sale deters somewhat from the relaxation experience.  The rooms are nicely equipped, clean, and smell very nice.  This is one of those reviews where the cliched \""I want to give 5 stars  but...\"" comes into play.  Was my massage decent?  Yes.  Have I had better massages?  Yes.  I left relaxed, but not feeling like jello s I usually do after a massage. Would I go back here?  Maybe, based on proximity and atmosphere.",1

1058,0,"Not gonna lie, was totally disappointed this time around when I ordered the Classic Steak Sandwich and Classic Chicken Club. I don't know if it's because the place was JAM packed (because of the World Cup) this past Saturday, but the food was seriously lacking. Even as I passed by each person's table, the nachos and burgers all looked pretty unappetizing.\n\nMy biggest gripe was that the Classic Chicken Club sandwich was described as being the Fat Heads' Classic Steak Sandwich but substituted w/ chicken... it totally wasn't. Not only that, the grilled chicken they used were also literally chicken chunks (yes, the kind used in salads). Honestly, who uses grilled chicken chunks in a SANDWICH? At least, use a slab of grilled chicken! This made for a messy and soggy sandwich, where all of the contents (including all of the grilled chicken chunks) fell out pre-bite.\n\nI'm willing to give this place another chance though... Stay tuned for an update.",0
1059,0,"3.5 Stars, Overall quite nice, but a few elements were lacking.\n\nI went to two different places with WP in the name, and they couldn't be more different from each other. One was in the airport and was a huge disappointment. This place however, is located in a mall on the strip and was quite good for a place within a mall (very upscale).\n\nWe ordered the mussels as a starter,  two pizzas, and few sangrias. The drinks were good and very refreshing. \n\nWere were served bread and butter to start. The bread was warm, soft, and crusty, all the qualities that good bread should have. The butter was served cold, I dont know if it was because we walked in two minutes before the kitchen closed or if that the way its normally served, but that was a negative. But the bread easily made up for this.\n\nThe mussels were steamed in a chorizo and garlic broth, and were served with some garlic bread. (picture included). The chorizo pieces (of which there were plenty) were almost better than the mussels, and ofcourse this lent to and excellent broth which we sopped up with the bread.\n\nOne of the pizzas had excellent quality toppings and both were well made. I personally prefer dough which is more chewy, but the way they cook it here is not too bad either. One pizza was a margherita, and the other had arugula and mushrooms. The margherita pizza, even though it was made on a technically good base,  was a huge disappointment.  It looked like a premade wood fired frozen pizza with a chiffonade of basil thrown on top. The cheese was also not very good, and it was definitely lacking in the tomato department.\n\nThe arugula and mushroom pizza was actually quite good. We all enjoyed it. I dont know all of the factors which made it so much better, but the cheese was completely different, and the drizzle of olive oil didnt hurt either.\n\nThe service was pretty much flawless, which is a pretty big deal given that they were just about to close when we walked in.\n\nI would definitely visit again.",2

The tailors were thorough and concise.  I must say this place is great when it comes to the value and service.",3
1061,0,"The Tap House is a great place to grab a beer with friends.

1064,0,I am a very picky restaurant patron and this place won me over! It's a total hole in the wall where the chef is right in front of you preparing really amazing meals.

1069,0,"Clearly worth 4 stars! One of the best sushi restaurants in the valley! It's better than Ra but not better than Sushi Roku. The service was also excellent. The waitresses are beautiful but friendly and didn't give off that trite Scottsdale \""I'm too good to work here\"" vibe. \n\nThe prices were not cheap. If anyone pretends this is affordable sushi, they are lying or stupid. We had a party of 4 and spent $130 including drinks. We only ordered maki rolls too. That same meal at Ra would have been less than a $100. It's not the most expensive sushi restaurant in the valley but it's not \""affordable or inexpensive\""\n\nThe only real knock on the place was it's claustrophobic atmosphere. This place is terrible for big groups. It's an ideal couples restaurant. We had 4 people and felt like our group was too big. There isn't much seating but they did their best to accomodate us. The restaurant is really narrow. \n\nI would recommend this restaurant but only for couples and for those willing to spend over $80 if you are going to eat and drink alcohol.",0

I had the \""signature\"" Diego Carne Asada, and there was no notable marinadey flavor that I associate with even the weakest carne.The chips were crumbs and the salsas forgettable.

1071,0,Yeah... I was not pleased at all with the food. I couldn't eat half of what I got (odelay scramble with hash browns).  The hash browns were very buttery and the scramble was a mess.  No real flavor other than butter and the coffee came with coffee grounds and was very bitter.,0

If your surrounded by pervs and nastiness, your pretty much stuck. No where to run and hide. Luckily, I saw me some eye candy the night I went. And close proximity within eye candy is always good. \n\nThe major down side is that there is no outdoor smoking patio. And if you know me, no patio = no fun.

1074,0,"This place sucked and I don't feel the need to return. Friends from work were planning a birthday happy hour and called two weeks ago to find out information on providing a location for the event. Approximately 20 people would be coming and the person making the call asked if that would be an issue and if reservations needed to be made. She was told no, it would be fine. The restaurant is very spacious, so it could easily handle a group that size. \n\nMy friend and I arrived first yesterday to secure the tables. The hostess said she didn't think she could accommodate us because they did have several parties that made reservations. She hesitated, but eventually said she could probably put about 15 in one area, which we accepted. It took a while, but the staff assembled three or four tables to provide the area we needed. We went ahead and sat down and my friend asked the waiter when happy hour began and what specials they had. The waiter stated the happy hour was only in the bar area or patio, and not at the tables. He left and then a manager came out and repeated the same thing. My friend asked what if people walked to the bar, ordered and paid for the drink and returned to the table. The manager said no, you can't do that. We explained there would be people at the table eating in the restaurant portion, but there might be people order drinks from the bar and come back. The manager said if that were to happen, he couldn't hold the tables for us. While the explanation was occurring the waiter was kind enough to bring out some water for us, and a third member of our party showed up to order a diet coke and was planning on getting the quesadilla, but waited. Soon it became clear this place would not work out too well for the party.\n\nLooking over the menu, the prices seemed too high for a bar with a bull in inside. $10 burgers, egg rolls for $9, $8 quesadillas, $10 salads and $9 specialty drinks.  Happy hour prices the specialty drinks come down to $5, imports and well drinks for $3 and domestics for $2 - but again, only in the bar and only in the first-come-first-serve patio area.  If you have a large group, you most likely won't be to be in one of those areas or see those prices.\n\nI do know some restaurants keep the happy hour prices contained to certain areas, but it typically depends on the restaurant structure. A place, for example Applebees, is mostly restaurant and happens to have a bar, so it would make sense to keep the prices separate. Cadillac Ranch is more bar than restaurant. I don't know too many places trying to promote a nice restaurant image that would have a mechanical bull in main area.  Apparently the management is not interested in the revenue that 15-20 people eating and drinking all night would generate.\n\nAfter the manager's conversation, the waiter was a little slow in returning. I walked down to San Felipe but they could not accommodate our party at the last minute. In the end, we found a suitable location that provided the service, the happy hour pricing and atmosphere we wanted.\n\nThanks, Cadillac Ranch, but no thanks.",0
1075,0,"From check-in to check-out, Sanctuary Spa provides the ultimate spa experience. When it comes to my spa days, I like to choose wisely because I save my funds very carefully to treat myself to a spa experience. Because I save my pennies so carefully, I want an A+ experience at the spa I choose. Sanctuary gets an A+. \n\nI am going to be very detailed in my review, because when I'm looking for a spa I want to know every little thing about the spa. You will notice that the Sanctuary does an excellent job with the little extras that make a spa experience that much better. \n\nSetting:\n\nThe Sanctuary Spa is nestled on the base of Camelback Mountain. You enter through a plush neighborhood of beautiful houses and walk past state of the art tennis courts before entering the spa. I would call this spa intimate and state of the art. Yes, I've been to bigger spas, but bigger isn't always better. I opened the doors of the spa and entered a small check-in table where the staff greeted me with smiles and charm. They had me give them my CC upon arrival so that I wouldn't have to stop by and pay on my way out if I was in spa-mode. After check-in, they led me through double doors where two more spa attendants waited to give me a tour of the locker room and key to my own locker room. \n\nLadies Locker Room \n\nThe ladies locker room has everything I look for in a spa. It has a vanity area with lotions, hair spray, shaving gels, and several other products to use while getting ready. The bathrooms are spacious and offer mouth wash and disposable tooth brushes and toothpaste for use throughout the day. The private walk-in showers are also spacious and provide shampoo, conditioner, body wash and razors. The individual lockers offer a robe, flip flops and a towel. The jacuzzi is pretty small but on the quiet day I visited, it was just the right size. The waiting room for services is intimate but again, just the right size. They have hot tea, ice cold water, almonds and dried cranberries for guests to enjoy throughout the day. The ladies locker room provides the perfect setting for a relaxing day. \n\nThe Gym \n\nWhen I do spa days, I like to take full advantage of every amenity they offer. After all, I am paying a pretty penny so I want to get my money's worth! I tend to visit the gym first because then I feel even better going into my spa day. This gym is definitely a nice one. They offer complimentary water and Gatorade at the gym. The treadmills overlook a lap pool through large floor to ceiling windows so it's easy to day dream while you workout. The treadmills have TVS and complimentary disposable head phones just in case you forgot yours. They also have ellipticals, weights, bikes and offer a variety of fitness classes throughout the day. \n\nThe Pools \n\nI would say the spa lap pool is the only downfall (in my opinion) at the Sanctuary. During my spa days, I like to enjoy a tranquil pool that's not \""in the scene.\"" I like to saunter out there before and after treatments, lay out and relax. The Sanctuary spa does offer access to their two pools, but one is a lap pool without much \""spa\"" ambiance to it. It's more just like a workout pool with some lounge chairs. The other pool is the stunning negative edge infinity pool in the main hotel area. The pool itself can't be beat and sits against a backdrop of the desert and palm trees. It was beautiful, but it was also in the middle of the action, so it made my spa day a little more rambunctious than I was hoping for. However, the pool itself was beautiful and I've definitely seen wilder pools. Just be prepared to be in the scene if you go. \n\nThe Services \n\nNow let's talk services. I will say that my two technicians might be my favorite of all my spa experiences in the Valley: Sherry especially. Sherry gave me my Sanctuary Jewel facial which is a 50 minute facial that's customized to your skin. From the moment I met Sherry, she was so incredibly nice and made me feel at ease. She's Southern and her Southern friendliness definitely was in full force! Now, getting a facial can be nerve-racking because you are letting someone examine every flaw on your face. It's important that your technician makes you feel comfortable during the facial. Not only did Sherry make me feel comfortable, but she found traits to compliment me on throughout the facial and did it in a truly genuine manner. Not only was she nice, she gave me an amazing facial! I left with my skin glowing and my confidence still intact! For that I will continue to visit Sherry for facials. \n\nI had my massage done by Tara who did such a good job, I nearly fell asleep! Now be prepared for them to try to upsell you on products before the massage. That was the only downfall, but it's not the massage therapists fault for doing what they are told to do! I didn't add any extras, but the regular Swedish massage was all I needed!",3

Guac and chips were fresh and lovely.  Entrees so good.  And I broke my one-margarita rule and ordered a second one.  Service was a little slow but very friendly.  Might have had something to do with the large bachelorette party in the same section.  I do recommend it.  Above average Mexican food! (And I know my Mexican food!)",4

They've got a La Marzocco Linea and a serious group of grinders - Mazzer Robur, Elecktra Nina, and Two Compak K10s - they mean business. \n\nI had a double espresso - described as a Papua New Guinea single origin with citrus and berry flavors.  It was pulled more of a traditional volume at 2oz+, but I was getting a little sweetness with some earthy flavors.  They have a couple of espresso bean options, so trying others might have found one a little more to my liking. My dad had a latte, which was pretty good - maybe the coffee works better in milk.\n\nThe barista was friendly and open to talk about the coffee, which was nice.  They roast on site, which is a plus too.  The place has a lot of potential, so it will be interesting to see what they do in the future.",2

It got stressful taking her to a groomer with barking dogs, blow dryers etc. Not to mention our Groomer of 6 years flaked out on us. I called Green Dog Mobile Grooming yesterday for the first time and had to leave a message. I chose this Co because of their reviews. I left a detailed message with my phone # and wanted to know how soon they can come out. That was over 24 hours ago and no call back. I called again and got voice mail again. I hung up. I understand people are busy but 24 hours is a little too long to not return a call for a potential new customer. I guess I will keep looking.

1082,0,"I wasn't going to write a review about this place till I visited it again. Take this 3-star with a grain of salt, as I ordered the wrong ramen for my palate and wasn't crazy about the place. But with so many ramen places popping up around the valley, it may be some time before I come here again. So before I forget, here it goes... \n\nI got the Mame chashu. Ok, this type of miso broth is going to throw off a lot of people. I wouldn't say this is a pure \""ramen\"" place, I'd say it's  50% ramen, 50% miso and this claim is backed up with various posters they have proclaiming the health benefits of miso soup. The Mame is not like the miso at the Monta chains, it's more like Korean miso, as in Dang-Jang-Guk. And I'm not talking about the poser Dang Jang Guk, that uses pre-packaged Japanese miso. I'm talking about the real soybeans, painstakingly fermented then hand-ground by some old Korean aijimae. It's a completely different beast; it's hearty, slightly bitter, and very strong. \n\nPersonally, I don't care for this type of miso. But if that's your thing, the Mame was the best miso-of-that-kind that I ever had. You get a huge bowl with big slices of chashu for $12. It's pricey but you get what you pay for. \n\nThe place itself is very Japanese, minimally decorated but clean. They have great free wifi. \n\nThe place does serve the typical Japanese miso ramen, called Kome, which I imagine is closer to what is served at Montas. So, if traditional ramen is your thing, I highly recommend ordering that. They were all out when I went. \n\nThey've also got Ramune soda for $2.50. \n\nThe three-stars is based on personal taste. It's not a bad ramen place at all, just not for me. If I go again, I'll update accordingly. This place has potential!",4

My GF homemade pizza crust and packaged versions I get from Whole Foods were 100 times better.  Sauce on the pizza was too sweet.  The salad was drowning in dressing, Antipasto was also tasteless,  Flat bread was not good and the dips were mediocre.  \n\nSo bummed that it wasn't better.

1086,0,"*In cranky old person voice* - Buffets nowadays are getting more and more high-falutin', charging more and more for food that we can only look at longingly when our guts are full to the point of poppin!!\n\nFact - The d\u00e9cor at Bacchanal is equal to that of Michelin-starred restaurants, a setting in which overpaying for your food seems to make sense.  There is no question this place is beautiful.\nFact - The bounty is plentiful.  This is the stuff that could trigger sensory overload...think Willy Wonka and the Chocolate factory but with more than just candy.  \nFact - Their dim sum is better than most regular Chinese dim sum places I've been to in Orange County.  Sad to say but it's true!\n\nUnfortunately, the ultimate fact is...unless, you're some type of competitive eater (or secretly employ the use of a vomitorium like they used to do in the olden Bacchanal days), you're only eating 1/3 of what you're paying for the buffet.  Everything else is going to the cost of d\u00e9cor and excess food.  \""Getting your money's worth\"" is a purely subjective mission here.\n\nAs beautiful as the rest of the place was, hubby and I got shoved into what appeared to be an overflow room where our chairs didn't match and our table was no better than a two top in a French caf\u00e9.\n\nFood was plentiful as I mentioned and nothing really stood out. It was definitely a shock and awe type feeling.\n\nMy biggest issue with this place was the service.  Our server was ok, not super attentive so we didn't get refills unless we craned our necks to flag him down.  The biggest offender, however, was the surly possibly racist jerk at the carving station.  I witnessed him being openly rude to a meek lady with limited English skills and then suddenly offering the next few Caucasian people the biggest brightest smiles and an almost subservient tone of voice.  When it was my turn, I was once again shocked at his brusqueness and his rude tone of voice.  I smiled/chuckled and asked him if he actually gave away the entire ribeye to which his reply was an icy glare accompanied with \""No, you can't have the whole steak.\"" I ended up with the worst, fattiest cut he could scrounge up for me.  My next visit to his station was wordless even when I attempted some banter.  I'm typically a \""live and let live\"" type of person but if I ever run into this guy again, I believe will call him out on his rudeness.  A subsequent courtesy email to Caesar's customer service received no response.\n\nAs other Yelpers have noted, it's more expensive than typical buffets out there.  It just depends on whether you think you're willing to pay for d\u00e9cor and maybe slightly better tasting food.  I'm still down with Wicked Spoon....",0

Looking forward to the first tolerable outdoor temps this summer, sat outside on the patio which we were told was non-smoking. Patio was quiet and peaceful--we were the only table seated out there until several people came out, sat a few tables over from us and started smoking.  Disappointed, we immediately got up and went inside. Asked the waiter about the smoking and he moved our food and drinks inside rather than ask the smokers to smoke elsewhere.\n\nSitting inside was no better.  The group at the small bar was very loud and vulgar. Even a restaurant employee was literally screaming inside the dining room.\n\nWhen we got the check the waiter explained that he took two drinks off the check because the smokers were actually restaurant employees on a smoke break. WTF?!  He would have been better off not telling us that the smokers were employees.  If he didn't tell us we might have considered coming back. Knowing that the manager allowed employees to smoke on the patio while paying guests were dining out there only motivates me to write a review, not return and spend more of my hard-earned money.\n\nNo amount of great service or decent food can make up for a 100% unacceptable, avoidable and miserable restaurant atmosphere. \n\nZero effort was made to show even the most minimal consideration for that fact that paying guests were dining in the restaurant.

I believe that rhubarb wasn't countered by a sweet enough berry.  And it was a tad dry.\nI had butterscotch pudding.  The pudding was good but it was topped with a ton of whipped cream.  The cream was clearly homemade so big thumbs up for quality but it tasted of bourbon.  I understand why, I am just not a fan of bourbon really.  My espresso martini that I paired with it was FANTASTIC though.  \n\nService was great--good recommendations on wine and very friendly.  We didn't feel like we \""waited\"" for anything.

I think it's absolutely crazy that they don't answer the phone during the lunch rush. To me, that is really poor service. Don't get me wrong, obviously by my rating I truly like this place, but to say you're not going to answer the phone because of the rush seems almost...lazy. There are PLENTY of places that have lunch rushes, and some bigger than here and they answer the phones. I almost didn't come here because I originally was told about this place from a coworker so I Googled their number and called to find out more specifically where they were located. But instead of speaking with someone I listened to a message that stated no one would answer the phone during this time. It's a good thing I found them because had I not, that alone would make me not want to try them. It's a pretty big inconvenience to customers who have never been or would like to know about the items they carry. I just don't feel a business should ignore their customers just because they're busy.\n\nEven with the above I will still come here because the sandwiches are excellent!!!

The end.\n\nAlthough I already cried my woes over the roasted chicken entree, I did not mention that it was neither herby nor garlicky as advertized, and the plating design left something to be desired.  I was surprised that there was not a hint of green anywhere on the plate to balance the colors, and it looked sadly bare.  Also for being roasted, the chicken skin lacked the crunch I so needed and the potatoes were quite soggy.\n\nThe $5 chocolate pot de creme was a smooth chocolate custard made with Vahlrona chocolate.\n\nThe problem?  It is described as a rich, chocolatey dessert.  While it was not horrible (we did finish it, after all...), I've had a lot better and a larger portion for the same price elsewhere.  It did not give the Vahlrona chocolate the respect it deserves.\n\nThe $5 creme brulee was smooth, but did not have the glassy crackle a good brulee should have.

We were actually the first diners in, and were followed by a solitary gentleman about 10min later.  Despite the fact that he arrived after us, he received his food and we nearly through eating before we ever got ours.  Perhaps this was due to the fact that as soon as he arrived, the waitress spent 98% of her time chatting with him.

What a dissappointment, and it was truly upsetting to have spent my hard earned money on such complete rubish.  \n\nIt's my opinion that the only reason this place gets any good reviews results from the fact that the people of Maricopa are used to such an extremely low quality of dining to choose from, that the food at Sunrise actually tastes good to them.

Thanks again to the shop and Steve,  (manager)  for caring.  I'm telling all my friends and neighbors about this shop.",4
1113,0,"Airport food...stale, over priced under served, right? Well, this place is a real treat. From the cold beer to the ceasar salad to the fresh hot pizza this never ending succession of impression is capped off by fantastic service (seat yourself seating brings tips under question, but these folks hustle the food out hot with a smile).  I'm a bit of a ceasar snob, yet the chilled lettuce, light dressing with just the right bite, plenty of Parmesan, and fresh made croutons won me over and then some.  And an entre size salad for $6 was very impressive! As was the $8 pizza thin crust with fresh basil (I've had smaller pies for twice that price!).  I think I may fly the family out next time just to eat here!",3
1114,0,"First came here when I was 10 years old and I fell in love with it. I have so many memories in this hotel. Now I'm an adult and whenever I visit Vegas I stay here. The rooms are great and comfortable. The place is so beautiful in my opinion. Although, when I last visited I noticed SO MANY COUPLES AND NEWLYWEDS. I was bummed along with my sister because we were looking to see some cute guys lol. We were not allowed to go to bars or clubs (not 21), so we sat in the lobby and we just saw couples pass in large numbers. So all the single ladies who are looking for some fun you might look somewhere else. But we passed by the TAO nightclub and we noticed many singles but once again it was restricted for us. In the end The Venetian is my favorite hotel of Las Vegas and I can't say I will ever stay anywhere else when I visits hopefully this year.",4
1115,0,"Time for an update, and I'm taking away a star for one reason. The food has remained delicious and the lunch specials are priced right (the lamb vindaloo I had there on 4th July was awesome), but there's something that pissed me right off when I ordered takeout recently. Portion size. It's $9-$11 dollars for an 8-oz container of food, depending on what you get. Get three different containers along with rice and a naan and you're almost at $40. That's WAY too expensive, no matter how tasty the food is. I know how to make this stuff (technically, although I have problems achieving the flavour) and I know what the ingredients cost. They're making money hand-over-dot at this place and the final issue I have is that my 8-oz container of chicken makhani was less than half chicken and the rest sauce. See my Tandoori Village review for more information on this. They need to knock their prices WAY down. I want a take-out meal for two and I want it to be under thirty bucks. When I can get three pounds of Chinese food for under $20 (see my review of Chen & Wok in Surprise), paying double that for less food doesn't strike me as a particularly good deal. Don't anyone make the mistake that this place is haute cuisine either. It ain't Gaylords. Not by a long shot. And Gaylords is pretty far from haute cuisine itself.",0

I took a taxi here to go down to London and the moment I went underground I was amazed at how unorganized this place seems.  Maybe me or maybe it was the construction that was going on.\n\nAll the usual amenities you would expect from a modern train station, you have a pub nearby, the snack shop and all of the other usual suspects are here.  The open roof feeling of being underneath main roads doesn't sit well with me, because it rains here and it is cold here more than it is warm so why an open roof. And being from California being underneath big things that can collapse just rubs me the wrong way, almost as much as finding out that the trains to London are on a track all by itself not with the others.

The feats of strength and flexibility produced by these men and women are a delight to see. The costuming and prop work were flawless, the music was enchanting, the light show was magical and the crew did an amazing rigging job. It's too bad that most of the scenes, or chapters within the show, get lost in the overall theme or story. Elements of the concept were confusing, missing and unnoticeable to me and that's too bad. Comical punctuations sprinkled throughout the show, although enjoyable, only served to further dilute the show's impressive sets. \n\nOverall, quite a decent first glance at the world of Cirque. On the other hand, veteran viewers will find the holes in its production glaringly obvious.",2

I am a former Wegmans employee and started working for the company at 16, so I never realized what grocery stores were like outside of that and when I move to Charlotte, I was unpleasantly surprised. I really enjoyed everything about the store. My first trip there I probably spent over an hour and half walking around and seeing everything they had to offer. Prices are fairly reasonable for what you are getting and not that big of a jump in the total bill compared to a Food Lion, BI-LO, etc. Loved the wine/beer selection and the gourmet cheese ( ask the employees to taste something if you aren't confident you will like what you are thinking about purchasing). The employees were so incredibly friendly, that I spent 15 mins at the deli just chatting with the gentleman behind the counter. Lots of freshness, great customer service and options in product. I am glad Whole Foods has touched down in Charlotte.",4

1130,0,"I had not been to a Grimaldi's in about five years prior to this visit. I knew that it was a rather pricey pizza restaurant but I was craving pizza and we were at San Tan Mall so I figured I would give it another try. I was with my sister and she did have her dog with her so we asked one of the manager's if we could sit outside on the patio with the dog. At first she said no but then she told us if we could find a seat near the edge of the railing and tie him up on the outside of the rail, we could eat on the patio. We did end up finding a perfect spot where we were able to tie him up and have him right next to us while sitting on the patio. It was really nice of her to let us do that and accommodate our needs with the dog. Good start.\n\nWe were pretty hungry last night and we both really wanted a starter of some kind, garlic bread, bruschetta, something like that... To our surprise Grimaldi's carries no form of appetizers other than salads. Salads are great and all but we just couldn't believe that they had no other kind of appetizer. When we asked our waitress if they had any sort of bread she  seemed almost irritated that we even asked. We decided that we would just end up ordering a starter caesar salad because really this was one of our only choices. We also ordered a large   pepperoni, onion and jalapeno pizza. The salad was okay. The caesar dressing was a little to bitter for me, a little too much vinegar for my tastes.\n\nThe pizza here for me is just okay. Some people really love Grimaldi's and to each their own, but it is just not the pizza of choice for me. The crust was a little over done which because of the coal brick oven gave it a slight burned taste. I did like the fresh mozzarella and that was probably the best part of the pizza but I found myself eating around other parts of the pizza just to get to the bits of cheese. I am just not a fan of Grimaldi's pizza and I won't find myself coming back here to pay $22 for a pizza I don't like. The service was pretty good. Our waitress was very attentive. I did get a slight sense of arrogance from her but overall she kept our drinks refilled and she did answer our questions even if she was a little snooty about it. I did give a three star because even though this is not the pizza for me, it is not bad pizza, just not my taste.",2

The steak I had, again overcooked, but had great smashed potatoes and perfect asparagus. Drink service was always good, especially when I was a regular.

I only ordered the veggie korma and a garlic naan to go, and the gentleman working there threw in some of those soggy dough nut dessert thingies, which was very sweet. Everyone was nice, my order was done on time, and the food was exactly what I had hoped for. My spice level for today was medium, which was good, but I think I'll go all the way next time.

With all the great things I heard, I had to go to Bink's Midtown as soon as I could. I regretted it.\n\nMy girlfriend and I went on a Saturday night and waited to talk to the hostess.  We waited a while, and I started to see what was happening up front.  The guy ahead of me said.. \""hey, what's going on? do we have a table or should i wait outside.. what do you want me to do?\"" they finally told him his table was ready.  \n\nMy turn came up and I sat there for 5 minutes watching them take one page after another and clip them together.  Why didn't they do this before hand? We were seated right next to the front door, but I would have rather been in the more inviting living room.  At least I wasn't seated outside where it was freezing.\n\nOur water came out promptly, but we waited 10 minutes before the server came.  We ordered a carafe of wine and waited another 15 minutes before that came out.\n\nService aside, I was excited by the menu.  We ordered the beets, leeks, risotto, mussels, parsnip soup, sweetbreads, beignets, squash, and brussel sprouts.  The waiter's eyes went a little wide, and he grabbed the table next to us to make more room.  Five minutes later the hostess came by and asked if we were expecting more people and why we didn't tell them?  I felt offended that they thought I pulled over a table and didn't say anything to them.  I explained the situation, they paused, and he walked away.\n\n20 minutes later. yes, 20 minutes later. our food finally arrived.  Of course, as they were putting the food on the table, they knocked over a glass of wine on to my girlfriend.  She somehow ninja'ed her way from getting anything spilled on her.  The worse of it all though, was she had to ask 2 different people to replace her glass of wine.\n\nThe food was some highs and lows.  The foei gras donuts and mussels were okay.  The leaks, beets, and risotto were great.  We especially loved the cheeks in the leaks.\n\nOverall though, I just wasn't happy with the place.  The service was horrible, and the staff had no energy or personality.  With all the waits we endured, I just can't recommend this place to anyone at all.\n\nWhat's worse is I give the valet my ticket and watch him almost stall out my car 3 or 4 times while trying to back up.\n\nMy two cents. Stay away for a few months.  Maybe then things will get better.",0

She seemed so distracted at everything else. \n\nThe food is usually served pretty quickly.  I always order the chipotle chicken and i always like it cause they taste the same every Panera location I go to.  My sister-in-law ordered one of the pastas and it tasted so horrible! The pasta was so chewy and it tasted like those middle-school lunches in the cafeteria.  It was just awful. \nThe baguette is usually a miss for me. Sometimes its soft and taste like it just came out of the oven and most of the time it is hard and tasted old. Also, I ordered chicken caesar salad that was probably the only thing that tasted good and fresh. \n\nAnyways, panera has a variety of selections you can choose from and there is something for everyone.

1161,0,"I first discovered Cornish Pasty at the Tempe location in 2006.  The food has always been delicious, so I was thrilled when they opened a location closer to home.  The food is still good, but there are two issues with this location that really need to be addressed.  First, as other reviewers have noted, there is a really bad odor inside the restaurant.  It almost smells like bad feet.  I don't know if its a particular food that is making that bad smell or what, but because of it, we always opt to eat outside.  When you enter a restaurant you should be greeted with a cornucopia of deliciousness -not a weird stench that makes you want to run.\n\nSecondly, the customer service.  This is consistently - inconsistent.  Sometimes its ok, and then other times its just plain terrible.  The other night we had to wait 1 1/2 hours for our food and we didn't see our waitress for over an hour--that's right-AN HOUR--no drink refills, nada.  In fact we almost just left.  I don't care how busy you are, that is unacceptable.  If the customer service was excellent, I could overlook the 5 earrings in the nose-20 tats-freak show waiters they have serving the customers.

There is simply no excuse for this type of excess in a driving city like Phoenix.  You'll spend 2 hours at the gym to burn off lunch here.

It's run by Lothian and Borders Police, but the museum isn't from a too overly police perspective. It tells the story of Edinburgh's police force and some of the more colourful episodes of Edinburgh's criminal history. Despite my initial lack of enthusiasm even I managed to find the displays entertaining.\n\nThe museum is literally one room and shouldn't take long to look around. The space is used efficiently and there's a decent amount to take in considering.\n\nIt's free, it doesn't take long and it's right in the middle of town.

How long does it take to make lasagna?

1169,0,"Man, I needed a quick fix after a night downtown and we literally stumbled upon this place.  \n\nI can't really say much as I was really drunk, however I do remember that the place is pretty small. There's a bar countertop and maybe a few chairs.   Little quaint place inside the casino.  The cashier who helped us was cordial and she even joked around a little with us which made it a great interaction.  \n\nFor the food, I got the mushroom swiss burger.  I can't remember the cost, however, I remember paying around 10 bucks for that and a shared appetizer of some sort.  What I do remember though, is that the burger was not flavored.  I thought it was super bland.  I the mushrooms were perfectly carmelized and the swiss did bring a little flavor, but the star of show (or supposed to be), the burger, wasn't really seasoned.  I really did enjoy the fries however.  They were super crispy and shoe string-ish.  My preferance!\n\nAll in all, it was an ok kind of place.  Not much to choose from that late at night but it did the trick!",2

He tried to tell me this food wins awards every year somewhere...  I definitely did not get anything that would win awards.  Oh, and although I pointed out specific problems in technique, he blew my issues off as being just \""a matter of taste\"".  Mind you, I was the only asian in that establishment - kitchen, and otherwise.\n\nKorean tacos - there is NOTHING Korean about these tacos.  We don't use shredded meat for one, its way too salty and all I tasted that had a Korean link was Soy Sauce (maybe some brown sugar?).  Owner/manager guy said of course its Korean, it has Korean spices in it.  I don't think he knows anything about Korean cuisine....\n\nCalifornia rolls - how do you mess these up?  I guess by not putting anything but crabmeat and a tiny bit of cucumber that was poorly matchsticked.  These were so bland, I ended up putting some of the Korean taco meat filling on top and added some of the shell crumbled up for texture.\n\nEel/Dragon roll - the Dragon roll had one thick slice of avocado across 3 pieces of the roll.  The eel was over done in sauce that tasted almost burnt - its either not seasoned right or over caramelized.  Of course this same sauce is found on the Eel sushi.\n\nThe Peanut butter Jellyfish roll - this was actually not too bad.  Nothing to write home about, but not completely wrong like everything else.\n\nI put pretty much all the wasabi we received into about half the saucer of soy sauce and could barely taste it.  Is it fake?  The rolls were also sliced unevenly, which is a fine detail that you appreciate at good sushi restaurants.  They were also not rolled tightly enough, so everything fell apart pretty much as soon as you grabbed it.\n\nAll in all, never again.",0

It seems like a nice salon. Kinda hard to find since its so off by itself. The parking lot was empty when I got there but I figure since it was evening no one might be getting their hair cut. Another customer was there and her hair was looking nice so I wasn't expecting this kind of experience.I got my hair cut by I'm guessing by a new hairstylist who was new out of beauty school. All I wanted was for my highlights to be done and a trim. I wanted my highlights to be a caramel color. Well after I was done sitting she washed the color out and when I saw my hair it was YELLOW! Not blonde or caramel like I wanted. YELLOW. I said it wasn't right so we went back with the toner. The owner walked in at the moment and was asked by the stylist what color of toner I needed. The owner then mixed it up after asking me what color I wanted my hair to be. After it was washed out it seemed ok. Not caramel still, but looked at the time to be ok. So we proceeded to the cut. I asked for just a trim. She did start cutting but she was just talking away and I was noticing that she was not cutting my layers at an angle like I've seen previous stylists do with cutting. She was Just cutting my layers straight. She asked if I would like my hair thinned out and I said yes. She pulled out a razor and began to hack away at my hair with it. I don't know much about hair cutting but I know when other stylists have thinned out my hair its with one of those special looking shears made for that. So after a 5 MINUTE \""trim\"" she started to blowdry my hair which that didn't come out bad and I paid and left. So afterwards when I got home I started looking at my hair closer. I noticed that my hair looking almost an ORANGE color. I just washed it today and now I see the real damage that the woman did to me hair. It looks absolutely awful! The \""layer\"" that she hacked away at my hair look just monsterous and the top \""layer\"" is almost above my ear so I don't know how the heck I'm supposed to be able to find someone to fix it. I'm trying to grow it out and its so bad I have a feeling I well have to hack a lot of it off. Its so raggity looking now..and that orange color is bothering me even more.

The place looked decent from the outside, so we strolled in for a basic, quick brekkie. To start, service was dreadful. After being seated we waited for 15 minutes to even be acknowledged by the waitress. It must have taken about 45 minutes before any food arrived. By that time all of our coffees were empty and our waitress ignored us until we basically begged for coffee. I gotta say, she was quite skilled at ignoring the restaurant patrons. Other tables were holding up their cups asking for refills just as well.\n\nThings only got worse from there.

The hostess sat us down without a word.  We had no idea why she had not given us a menu and waited 20 minutes before I asked a passing waitress if we could have a menu, only to be told rudely that they were already on the table.  You see, the 'menu' is in a form of a newspaper that was folded in two and tucked under the ketchup bottle. We had noticed the 'newspaper' but though it was just that, a newspaper.  The hostess never explained this to us.  \n\nAllow me to add that we arrived after the lunch rush time. We waited another 20 minuted before our waitress came to see us.  I had no idea she was in fact going to be our waitress before she presented herself to us.  You see, our waitress had been 'cruising' the gentleman who was alone at the table next to us.  They ultimately exchanged phone numbers. She was more preoccupied with flirting with him than she was with doing her job.\n\nIt wasn't difficult to notice how scantily clad the women employees in this place dress.  I have nothing against sexy attired women, but this was ridiculous.  Three of the four waitresses had tops that were so low cut that I felt very uncomfortable. What is up with that concept ? Looking around I noticed that there were more male patrons than women, and I guess that I shouldn't of been surprised.  My adult son obviously didn't mind their dress code, but then again, he is a man. \n\nI doubt I will ever go back there again.  The food was quite bland and the decor left a bad taste in my mouth.  My son's nachos were burnt (black) and when we pointed this out to our waitress, she told us that nachos were supposed to be burnt.  Wow ! Really !?  This is not the first time we order nachos in a restaurant. In any case, this place should focus more on food quality than on attracting clients with eye candy. \n\nIf any of you have seen the movie 'forty year old virgin', than you probably remember that scene where the main actor is on a speed date and he constanly tries to close his own shirt as a reaction due to the woman in front of him having a wardrobe malfunction.

1194,0,"It was fated that Bachi Burger and Us would meet last Sunday at the Las Vegas Valley Book Festival's \""Feasting on Words\"" Event.  I read about it on Yelp, went to check it out and was pleasantly surprised to see such a well-organized event that evoked a sense of community, somewhat unusual for Vegas.\n\nBachi Burger chefs were among other local restaurant chefs there, slaving over an open grill to serve fresh food representative of their venues.  Bachi was serving these miso sliders that really stood out above the rest.  Kobe patties topped with fried quail eggs sandwiched between warm soft buns had me wondering why I never went to their restaurant before, especially since I live less than five miles away.\n\nWe made our trip tonight and I am now so thankful to have been paying attention to Yelp events.  The restaurant is minimally decorated, modern and clean, fitting for an Asian-inspired gourmet burger joint.  \n\nWe started with the parmesan truffle fries, which were very tasty, crispy (not burned) and not too greasy.  I really liked the Bachi pickles, which were a combination of pickled veggies: radish, onion, carrots.  They provided the addictive sodium and crunchy companion for the fries and burgers, which were worth the wait.  (I've read reviews that the service can be slow here; ours was not slow, but longer than many other burger joints, which make sense to me since these burgers taste like they were made with much care and effort).\n\nThe Vietnamese in me desired the Banh-Mi burger, and the Vietnamese in me was right.  The Banh-Mi was a culmination of flavors: sweet from the Vietnamese ham (cha lua), salty from the fish sauce, tart from pickled cabbage, and spicy from the chili peppers.  All of this were served between two pate-covered buns, a perfect harmony.\n\nI was too full for dessert, but am looking forward to trying the Portuguese donuts with Saigon cinnamon on my next Bachi experience.\n\nBefore we left, my boyfriend said, \""We should be careful who we bring here, since we may run into them all the time from then on\"".",4

Your food and service can be sub par but if you have amazing chips and salsa I will love it!  Not sure if ours was an old batch, but half our chips were wet and oily and the salsa was just tomato sauce with some canned diced tomatoes. Nothing special or tasty. \n\nI ordered a margarita just the house on the rocks no salt. We were sitting at a cocktail table so I watched the bartender grab a pint glass dump some ice in it then reach for a blender pitcher full of old pre made margarita and pour it in my pint glass. The server brought it out to me I explained that I really wanted a fresh made margarita. After a little discussion I just said no thanks I don't want a margarita anymore ill stick with water.  We finally ordered and then our food arrived and I cut open my chicken chimichanga to find it was beef. And my husbands chile con carne was supposed to come with tortillas. When the waitress came by again I explained that my chimichanga  was wrong and told her I thought my husbands came with tortillas. No apology offered for the mistakes. She just said oh ya  I can get you a side of tortillas if you want, as if she was doing us a favor. When mine finally came out corrected (my husband was done with his food by this point) it was correct but not really good. The chimichanga wasn't crispy (it's fried so it should be crispy, it was pretty soggy) and the black beans were just okay nothing special or flavorful. \n\nService wise - terrible. Once I sent back the margarita the server was cold, inattentive and refused to speak to me only looking and speaking to my husband. The manager did come by to address \""my question about the margarita\"" offering no apologies for their methods just saying that they go through 60 gallons per week of margaritas. So what?!? I want a fresh made margarita not some warm pitcher of old margarita that has been sitting out on the counter for who knows how long. (By the way shouldn't margarita mix be refrigerated?) also after both our orders had issues we never received an apology or a manager visit or a comp or discount. Not expected but still nothing done about the problems. \n\nAfter all that I have no reason to come back.

1202,0,"SATURDAY NIGHT SPECIAL\n\nBefore we packed our Vegas bags, I commented to my husband that while there, I wanted to find a cheap lobster dinner. Some wives probably ask to be taken out to a nice lobster dinner. I wanted a nice dinner too, don't get me wrong, but I knew a cheap lobster dinner could be found and I wanted us to find it.\n\nWe were there less than 48 hours when dinner found us! We had been walking around Downtown Vegas and seen signs on the Fremont Hotel for an $11.99 steak and lobster dinner. I pointed it out with excitement. Unfortunately, we weren't hungry! But....after a couple more hours strolling and dancing, our appetites caught up and it happened to be between the hours the special was being served!\n\nWe had a 30 minute wait and we were not alone. The waiting area was packed! We were finally sat and our server (George) dropped off menus on his way to take another order. He returned not long after with a smile, even though I'd watched him scurry from table to table in the interim. His section was slammed and one booth was pretty impatient about not having received their bill yet. We decided we weren't in a hurry and placed identical orders (lobster and extra rare steak). I added a side dish of garlic green beans to mine.\n\nBread service came. A plate of Promise (buttery spread) packets came with it. A serious mound of fake butter! We ate our share until the dinners arrived.\n\nI don't anything nice to say about the flat piece of steak I received, except that it was very rare and it wasn't bad dipped in butter, but mine was mostly fat. Husband ate all of his and said it was about what he expected. We both agreed the lobster was better than expected. They were tiny tails but they were tender and well-seasoned and the drawn butter coated the bites nicely. My green beans were actually terrible. Rubbery and not much garlic to be found. For the meal we received, the excellent service, and the cost, overall I would say we found a great value here!  ($28.40 total)\n\nA good server can really set the tone for the evening.

We had chips and salsa, with the salsa tasting pretty much like Pace (not my fave), and a triple side of quac (since the order is actually quite small our server was kind enough to combine three orders into a larger bowl). The guac was pretty flavorless, and we heard the same from our buddies that ordered the quesadilla. \n\nThey did have Tecate though, and limes, and again our waiter was great and the bill wasn't a total punch in the gut since we didn't order that much. I would say if you're in a South of the Border state-of-mind at the Charlotte airport, a Tecate at Tequileria will do you right, but maybe try and spice up the food with some lime juice and/or an unmarked vile of house blended spices (like the one my mom gives me and expects me to carry around to season my food).",0

1207,0,"My whole family, my friends, and myself are pretty frequent customers of this location. Every time we have come in the past we really enjoy it and get pretty good service. Today I took my mother and my younger sister to lunch during happy hour. We ordered two cuts of sushi which were phenomenal as always (my favorite sushi chef is Peter and is the only employee I gave a tip to today). After this we also ordered a Kabuki Deluxe plate and a Chicken Teriyaki and Tempura plate. First of all, we waited probably 20-30 minutes AFTER we had already finished our two orders of sushi for our main plates (Chicken Teriyaki and Kabuki Deluxe). We asked our waiter if our plates were coming out soon and he said that they would be coming out shortly because there was a new trainee chef and that they had messed up the Kabuki Deluxe the first time that it was being made. When the two plates finally came out, the chicken teriyaki was VERY RAW (I did eat one piece that didn't look raw before figuring out that the meat was raw). I ended up not eating any of the chicken teriyaki. The tempura that came with this plate also only had ONE shrimp tempura, the rest was just vegetables. On my younger sister's Kabuki Deluxe, the Teriyaki Chicken was ALSO raw and her beef tips were not raw, but definitely not fully cooked (she also ate some of the beef tips). Her side of tempura that came with her meal also only had one shrimp tempura with the rest being vegetables. Both my younger sister and I do not feel good after our visit and had to visit Urgent Care where we were told to wait 12 hours for any signs of food poisoning. We had some employees approach us about the meal and apologize, but their tone was not very urgent and very robotic-like (not very sincere). They took care of our meal and had us fill out a food-borne illness report to check up on us probably later tonight. We were NOT approached by the main manager, we were only communicated with through other \""higher up employees\"" which I found was really strange. A meal that was supposed to be enjoyable for my sister, my mother, and I did not turn our that way. My mother left very unhappy and only ended up eating a couple of rolls of sushi from the beginning of our meal and ended up losing her appetite after the experience. Although the meal was taken care of my mother and I were a little surprised that a free meal or something complementary wasn't offered to us so that we would have an incentive to come back and try the food again (hopefully better the next time around). We are very surprised to be writing a bad review about a restaurant that we go to so frequently, but RAW meat is a very serious matter and needs to be notified at a high urgency. Thank you for your attention.",0

1209,0,"Yum! Yum! Yummy! Yum and yummy!!  The best breakfast and Mexican Hot Chocolate I have ever had!!!! This place was soooo amazing we back tracked to have it again the next day!! The first day I had a milk chocolate Mexican Hot Chocolate and the 2nd day I had the White Chocolate Mexican Hot  Chocolate...Oh my goodness...delicious!! Seriously, so rich and yummy.  The food was just downright amazing. It is hard to describe something that tastes soo good. The wait staff were extremely gracious and the manager even came to our table just to see how we were enjoying our experience! They have a chocolate shop within the restaurant so we went by to look and they had these caramel pecan candies dusted in chocolate  powder to sample that were AMAZING!!!!! So, so, so good! I want to eat here again and again! I had the breakfast skillet and everything was cooked to perfection. It wasn't greasy, all the ingredients tasted fresh and the diamond dusted biscuit with chocolate sauce is heavenly!!! DIVINE! I mean, DIVINE! One of the most amazing meals I've had to date!",4

This is the worst experience I've ever had traveling. 2 hour delay going, 1.5 hour delaying coming. Combine that with bag charges of $150. \n\nOriginally my ticket from Oakland to Las Vegas was $149 roughly $20 cheaper then southwest. Bag charges brought my ticket to just below 300. The delays caused me to have to pay for an extra day of parking as well.",0

1212,0,"Let me start by saying whatever happened to cooking Christmas dinner? I am Jewish, so for me Christmas= Chinese food, but apparently the secret is out. I went here tonight with the BF. We had made reservations for 7:30 and arrived at 7:20. The place was clearly understaffed as the two hostesses were running around like crazy acting as waitresses and bussers in addition to trying to host. As we stood there waiting for our table, about half of the tables in the restaurant left. You would think that this would make for a quick seating....surprise! It didn't. We waited for about 30 minutes to be seated. Additionally, several tables who did not have reservations were seated at the same time as us, which would have been fine if there were people working at this restaurant, but there weren't. So the BF and I sit there. The couple (without res) gets water, some small family that was seated at the same time gets water....we get nothing. The waitress comes around and takes their orders. Nothing. The family gets their appetizers and the waitress comes and takes their main entree order. Nothing. The other table gets their beers and sushi...still nothing! The hostess finally came by after at least twenty minutes and took our orders....we still do not have water. For real. And the place has gotten significantly less busy at this point. So we order the tangerine chicken and the pad kee mao with a 7/10 spiciness. We waited and waited. The other couple received entrees and just about finished them before we got our food. It was like we were in an episode of Seinfeld or something. The service was that bad. \n\nWe (finally) get our food and I will admit, the tangerine chicken was tasty. It was sweet and savory...pretty good. The problem is it was luke warm...like it had been sitting for awhile. Not cool. The pad kee mao was a disaster. First, it had about a 1-2 star spiciness level. Not spicy....at all. Second, in addition to not being spicy it was bland and kind of tasted like dishwater. Third, the veggies were still essentially raw. The dish was terrible. I have had much better (real) Thai food for a fraction of the price. We barely touched the dish, but no one showed us any concern or asked if our food was alright. The entire ordeal lasted one and half hours...for just entrees and water. Overall, the experience was terrible. \n\nI know what you're thinking....But Jennifer, it's Christmas!... Yes, I know it's Christmas, but I don't care, it isn't an excuse. I made a reservation. If they they did not have the space, they should have A) not given us a reservation or B) not let in walk ins when they had reservations. Whoever owns this restaurant should have put more thought into staffing for a night that they KNEW would be busy because they took reservations! It was unacceptable. The place only got a second star because the tangerine chicken was good, but I would be hesitant to go here again because apparently my business means nothing to this restaurant.",0
1213,0,My fianc\u00e9 and I were looking for BBQ on the 4th of July and decided to stop at Toms. I was looking for a reminder of how delicious BBQ is. For it to be the 4th of July the food was not satisfying. The ribs had lots of fatty pieces. The Mac n cheese was bland and it's possible that it was from the day before. The bake beans were straight from a can no unique taste. This place is good for someone who has never had BBQ before...,0
1214,0,"After months and months on hiatus I have made a resolution that I think I'll actually be able to keep (unlike the NYE 'resolutions' exercise and less carbs) and that is to get back to the good work of keeping up with yelp and my amateur reviews.  It started to feel like homework, but all fair and decent people need be warned of the good and the bad this and other cities have to offer by impartial peers'.  Now, it saddens me that my first update of 2010 will be such a disappointing experience that was Girasole last night.  However, I feel the need to document the experience immediately.  If only some other yelper could have prepared us for such disrespect perhaps we wouldn't have been taken so off guard (hence my warning to you...).  The lady and I wanted to try somewhere newish and I hadn't been here in over a year when I was the second to review this joint on yelp in 5/08.  I'm sure much of what I said then applies today, very loud...decent service, a little above average food with a seasonal menu.  I call and make a reservation well in advance so as to try to mitigate what I seem to remember always being a wait...We arrived at 8PM sharp for our reservation and don't get anyones' attention for a little while, but eventually do see who I assume is the owner.   We mention our reservation, he says no problem 15 min...Great!  I understand you're busy and we'll just wait a while...15 min, 20 min, 25 min...Okay, I'll try to make this easy..\""Sir, may I please give you my cell so you can just call when the table for 2 opens?\""...\""Sure, what is it?\"".  We go across the road to starbucks and wait for the phone to ring 30 min, 35 min, 40 min, 50 min...Now, keep in mind I booked a reservation well in advance.  We go back to the restaurant and wait again cramped like sardines cautious to make eye contact, which we do.  Okay, I know what you're thinking why not just leave?  I've already admitted it's nothing special.  I know you've been there...we kept thinking what if we leave now just when he's about to call.  So, we continue to wait and then someone walks in right behind us bumps Annie out of the way and just stands for maybe 30 seconds...the owner runs over bursts through Annie and I and just grabs the couple and seats them immediately.  I have never seen such blatent disregard for other customers'.  It was clear these folks were just regulars so he seated them ahead of everyone...what's so bad is it was right in front of us.  I can appreciate that we are not regulars' , but c'mon pops' have a little discretion.  Please take this as a cautionary tale, doesn't matter if you have a reservation, doesn't matter if you leave your cell (btw, still hasn't rang) and you pretty much don't matter if you're not a regular'.  There is a happy ending...We ended up at the bar at Eleven, I had a great tuna tartare and a piece of fish and Annie had a wonderful order of steak/frites.  We won't be back to Girasole.",0
1216,0,"The room and service were fine. I had a studio so the fridge is 18ft (5.5m) from the bed and the compressor can get noisy. The hotel is nicely situated in downtown. The walk from the Via Rail/central station is slightly uphill and 10-15 minutes, a nice, scenic walk. A ride from the hotel to Old Montreal via taxi was $12CDN with tip, and a taxi to the airport was a fixed rate of $38CDN w/o tip. I stayed in a room on the 14th floor, in an odd-number room, floor#\""03\"", and there is a nightclub across the street that pounds music all night, and has loud patrons outside until I don't know when (I put in ear plugs). If you are a light sleeper, stay on the even side room numbers of the hotel and don't face Peel St. Or, stay somewhere else. \nThe workout room is good sized and on the top floor with two treadmills, two elliptical, some free weights, and lots of room. Breakfast is on the mezzanine and was, meh, pretty average, but included. I'd spend the extra $40/night and stay at the Marriott-proper just a bit south again, when I come back. Views are better from there too, and it's more convenient. 1-star for the all night boom-chick-boom-chick music which made the stay very unpleasant, as well as the screaming patrons exiting the club. Eliminate the noisy music, it's a 3-3.5 rating.",1
1217,0,Need fat? Need carbs? Come here. I usually get a steak grinder (or sub I guess) and jalapeno poppers. They do the steak just how it is at home (the East Coast). I trust a place full of construction guys on lunch break. They also have good fried fish.,3

1220,0,"This review is for the cycle class only. \nI love to cycle. When I saw that the facility had a class daily I packed my shoes in my suitcase and was super excited that I could get my spin on while in Vegas. I didn't even mind paying the extra $20. Saturday was a long Vegas night but I made it to Sunday 9am spin hydrated and ready to sweat....until the music came on. I admit, I spin in a boutique spin studio in Los Angeles, but there is NEVER an excuse for bad music choice that you cannot coordinate a routine, coordinate pedal stroke to or gets you that motivation to keep going to...this was 45 minutes of what seemed like early 90's hair band rock and long drumming and guitar solos. OMG...it was painful. Oh, we did get one dance song in there! This was such a turn off I decided to not take the class the remaining days of my stay.  Instructor was good, but this is Vegas, the party should continue all the way to the cycle studio.",2
1221,0,"As many people have previously mentioned, there needs to be half stars because I would probably rate this as a 3.5. \n\nMy aunt really wanted to visit this buffet because it had been highly recommended by a friend of hers. We arrived at buffet at around 8p.m. and there was quite a line to get in. We were told that it was going to be at least an hour wait. We joined the line and settled in for the wait. \nLong story short, an hour and 15 minutes later, after dealing with a woman behind us who kept complaining about how hungry she was and how long it was taking for us to get in, large groups of people coming into the Invited guest line which ended with us having to wait at the beginning of our line for an additional 15 minutes, and then having to wait to be seated once we had paid, we were finally seated.\nBecause it was already after 9 and the buffet closed at 10, I was concerned that there wasn't going to be very much of a selection of food. The selection wasn't bad, but unless you're a seafood fan or like Italian, there really wasn't much of a selection. Many of the other dishes looked picked over and only had maybe a serving or two left. I had been hearing good things about the desserts but when I finally made it through the crowd to there, it looked like there was virtually nothing. The few different desserts that were still there had a lot of each of them, but there were maybe 5 or 6 different choices. \nI understand that we had gone late and they were going to be closing in less than an hour, but I was a little disappointed. The food was good, but I had expected more from the selection. \nThe highlight of our visit, and the reason that I ended up going up half a star and rating it a 4 instead of a 3 was our server Julie. She brought our drinks quickly and refilled without us having to ask. She also cleared the empty dishes and brought us new utensils quickly and efficiently. We had excellent service from her and it was much appreciated after a long day. \n\nI'm not sure I'll be back any time soon. If I do, it would have to be earlier in the day because I don't know if the dinner buffet is worth the $33+ and the wait in line. It was an okay buffet, though, and if you're in the area, have the time and the money to spend, then I'd say go for it. Just don't go after 8p.m.",0

I didn't know about the open seating.  This combined with them delaying boarding the plane until 8:30 made for a big mess.  There seemed to be no carry on bag restrictions.  I saw people with full on trunk sized suit cases trying to jam them into the overhead bins.  Meanwhile my bag is being jammed and crushed into who knows what.   \n\nDue to a mechanical issue we had to de-board and change planes.  Don't get me wrong I am thankful they caught the issue before take off.  I don't even want to think about the alternatives.

1233,0,I had a nice time here but wont be back too often unless we have someone visiting from out of town who wants to go.. The drink prices are too high for what you get. I paid $10 for a tiny cup of margarita. My friend paid $18 for a bigger one but you still didn't get enough for the price compared to a lot of other places around here. 2 of our friends decided to wait outside and not purchase anything after seeing the prices and size of drinks. I wanted to order at least 1 to try it.  I did think it tasted good just not good enough for the price. It was kind of dead in there too but maybe it was the hour we were there. We sat at the bar and just got a drink menu so I don't know about the food and might have to try that out someday. The staff was friendly and the place was clean inside. After 1 drink we decided to head to another place where we could get more drink for our buck.  I really had high hopes for this place and wish I could write a  better review but I have to be honest based on my experience.,0
1234,0,"I rarely drop a one star but this place did it.\n\nI stay at the Hardrock when I am in Vegas and was excited to try the new steak joint. This restaurant location seems to be cursed as both AJ's and the place after it didn't quite seem up to snuff. Went with a group of 9 guys on a bachelor party. There were 2 other groups there both under 10 people and maybe 4 or 5 other tables sat. In total, there were around 40 to 50 people there. This will come into play in a second. We sat down and service was fine. We ordered right away. Appetizers took 45 minutes to come out and our steaks came out 75 minutes after ordering them. I asked why it took so long and the server said it was because we were a big group. If a restaurant that seats over 100 can't service 10 customers when they are only half full, they need some major changes to the service.\n\nThen there was the food. I got the crab cakes which I would give a 3 out 5 for the crab cakes I have had in my life but at $15 for one very small crab cake, it should have been better. I split the tomahawk chop, ordered medium rare, with a buddy and ordered the the spinach as a side. Spinach was simple steamed spinach and was average at best and again I would have expected something more for $8 but this is my fault for not asking if it was just straight steamed spinach. The steak was bar none the worst $100 steak I have ever had. It would have been the worst $20 steak I have ever had if it didn't cost $50 a head. It came out medium well which I should have expected I guess since it was on the grill for so long. I would have sent it back but I didn't have another hour to wait for a replacement. There was no flavor to the meat at all which might have been from the overcooking but it was very fatty (which rib eye should be) and somehow still devoid of flavor. Our entire group had similar feelings with some of the guys feeling it was not bad but just mediocre.\nI have no problem dropping $100+ on a good dinner but that is not what this place had to offer when I was there. I hope they turn this around because I will be in the hotel again and hate having to drive somewhere to get a decent steak.",0

Next thing you know it made it's way down the line and crawled over three of my friend's feet! Finally, we stepped on it and ran and got the waitress. Gross. This is no reflection on the waitress - she was very apologetic - but seriously, a happy group reunion turned into a total gross out. We all wondered what was creeping around in the kitchen that we couldn't see! The Mimi's in Scottsdale is nice, this location is dirty and the a/c in the back room where we were seated was turned up. We were all sweating. (It was 93 outside today). I think the roach was trying to escape to the air conditioned side of the restaurant! Will never go back to this location.",0

1238,0,"Wow.......for all the wrong reasons. \n\nMy wife and I have seen a good amount of Cirque shows as well as other big shows offered in Vegas. When I saw previews about Zarkana I was pretty excited for its arrival. Without giving away too much about the show I'll just list the pro's and con's:\n\nBAD:\n\n- There was too much singing involved. I'm not 100% sure about this show but for other Cirque shows their songs are from made up languages. So essentially you're just listening to people sing and screech in gibberish.\n\n- The acrobatics were pretty boring and they kept on screwing up to the point it got annoying. This happened for at least 3-4 of the acts. \n\n- There might be a deeper meaning that I probably didn't understand but nobody in our group of 4 understood what the show was about.\n\nGOOD:\n\n- The  cannon scene.\n\n\nI would definitely NOT recommend this show to anyone. It was insanely boring, the story lacked direction and the singing was very annoying. KA still reigns supreme for Cirque shows(seen O, Zumanity, Ka and Zarkana). If you want humor I would highly suggest watching Absinthe in Caesars, which is our favorite show in Vegas.",0
1239,0,"Ok, I'm starting a new category called Hipster Hype.

Beckett's is fine. The meal will be pleasing, but it's overpriced for the execution:\n\nThe wait time for one drink will make it really hard to get a buzz on. If money is going to be spent on dinner, then that money wants to get drunk. Okay, not drunk, lightly buzzed ... still be able to drive. (Bad Teacher anyone? Cameron Diaz? Nope?

Two people ordered it this way at my table and neither one got it medium rare.\n\nThat's about as A-Ok as you can get, right? Hipster Hype, you can't fool me with your charming farmhouse inspired interior. \n\nEven my beloved Deviled Eggs were over-hyped. The only thing I felt was deserving of 5 stars was the service.

1247,0,So came down here on a Friday night to check out the local scene.  Well the NO COVER advertisement is a lie and no one was even here.,2
1248,0,"There are only 2 reasons I come here - okay, one big reason - Shellane! She is the best hair stylist I have ever had. I have never once had to bring a picture of what I want. During our first appointment she asked me a lot of questions about my morning routine, did I use product or not? Do I want to use product? How much time do I have to spend on my hair? etc. She then created this gorgeous look that I was able to recreate perfectly again and again afterwards. Every time I see her, I am soooo happy  with the results - she gets me. She is very hard to book, so if you are lucky enough to get her - make sure you book your next appointment right away and don't miss it (more on that later)!\n\nThat being said, this isn't a review on Shellane, it's a review of Ulta. This particular Ulta's customer service SUCKS! When you call the salon nobody EVER answers. I tried at least 5 times over a couple of weeks to book my appointment and nobody ever answered the phone. So I went in-store to book my appointment with Shellane. I waited for 5 minutes at the counter and nobody came to help me. I figured maybe the receptionist got pulled away for a minute, so I walked around the store for a few other items I needed. I came back, waited another 5 minutes and still nobody showed up. I had to go to the front counter and complain to get someone to help me. \n\nI missed one appointment with Shellane and it took me a month and a half to reschedule (after trying to call several times and going in-store I finally got an appointment). \n\nAlso, there is nobody on the floor to help you shop for products and if you're lucky enough to catch someone as they're speed walking from the front to the back, they have no knowledge of the products!\n\nHonestly, if Shellane wasn't the best hairdresser I've ever had - I would have started shopping elsewhere months ago! \n\nOh and if you're wondering what the second reason was - They (meaning corporate Ulta) have a pretty cool rewards program.",0
1249,0,"Ugh.\n\nThe story that I can tell that sums this place up involves a group of us guys roaming in here at 6a (having been up the entire night) and in desperate need of food. They had an \""all you can eat\"" pancake special going on, which at the time sounded fantastic. And then we got the pancakes - these were the driest things ever put together - more absorbent than a Sham-Wow. No amount of fake maple syrup could make these things palatable, which in our state is saying something. \n\nTerrible food. About the only thing that I've found on the menu that's any good is the bagel sandwich.\n\n(If you're wondering why I've gone back, well, it's the only 24-hour restaurant in the NYNY Casino, and sometimes convenience just wins out)",0
1250,0,"Not the hotel of my choice, but definitely fit the bill for sleeping accommodations. The desk staff was pleasant and very helpful in helping us find food at 9:30pm on a Monday night.",2
1251,0,I was impressed that they had a gluten free menu but there was not one gluten free vegan option so I just asked them to make me quinoa with vegetables.  Somehow what I got was a bowl of broth so I had to try to fish out my meal which now was soaked and had no flavor.  I can't imagine what the chef was thinking when he poured broth over my meal and turned it into soup.,0
1252,0,"In town celebrating my son's wedding, I came in to Vo's looking for a pedi/mani/fill's for 5 people on 6/6/14, including the bride.  \nOne of the best experiences we'd ever had. We all agreed on that.  The fact it's family owned and operated makes for a great time.  From the customers to the staff, everyone was happy and engaging.  \nThank you Vo's for being so attentive and making us laugh. We loved our time with you.",4
1254,0,Thought we would try it as it just opened. Food was good if pricey for Mexican (3 tacos $12.95). Extremely noisy. You cannot have a conversation ..just eat and out the door. Don't think I would make a point of going back.,0
1255,0,"The food was take it or leave it. Ordered escargot, Caesar salad (which isn't table side), steak and lobster which I ordered medium rare both came out overlooked, added a side of crab legs which was the best thing I tasted. The mixed veggies were just different colored carrots and they weren't as soft as carrots should be served. Garlic mashed potatoes and rice were delicious. Melted butter was salted, which i couldn't believe. Great ambiance and service. A bottle of Vueve Clicot was only 85$!!!! So I will come back for crab legs and champagne. No fresh desserts, they actually still rock the tray. Supposed to be the best value in Vegas, but there are better. We are spoiled with great steaks living here in Vegas",4
1256,0,Hubby and I went here on a date night. Sushi was yummy and so were the drinks. We went on a busy Sat. evening and there was a DJ so it was a little loud not overbearing though. Makes for good people watching. Our waitress was sweet and knowledgeable about the menu. We'll definately revisit this one.,3
1257,0,"I have eaten here a number of times, & a while back this place was pulling 4-Stars & everything was fine, but lately it has really been going down the drain.  Today, for instance, Mike C. & I stopped in for lunch.  You pay first, & then when I went to set my table place there were no teaspoons.  I entered the kitchen are & asked for one, which led to the manager telling me that they don't have them anymore because he tried to order some on the Internet & got tablespoons instead!  (Why wasn't he correcting the problem 2 minutes later, whenever that was??)  Fine, so I'll get along without, & just go get some salad.\n\nNo, I won't go get any salad.  The spot where the lettuce serving tray belongs is empty...  not even an empty tray, but just some ice down in the hole there!  Back in the kitchen, I ask for some lettuce to have a salad.  This leads to the manager bringing out a bowl of lettuce & a tray, & pouring the lettuce into the tray.\n\nAlong with my salad, I'll have some cottage cheese & a little of the seafood salad they always have.  Well, no, I won't.  They don't have either one any more.  In fact, there is little of anything on the serving table that used to always have a big bowl of the seafood salad, one of Hometown's signature dishes.\n\nThe rest of the food was weak, too.  Dishes overcooked, empty serving trays, watered down tasting soft serve ice cream, blah Lava Cake, & so on.  I have eaten at Hometown all over the country many, many times & I know exactly how they are usually run & exactly what most of the food is supposed to taste like!  They need a new manager here who will bring this big restaurant back up to the excellent place it used to be!     :-(",0
1258,0,"They have a happy hour that starts at 11pm, so we dropped in for some drinks/apps. \n\nOur waiter was a fucking zombie. I don't remember his name, but he was dead behind the eyes and slightly creepy. And you have to be pretty creepy for me to think you're creepy. \n\nAll of their signature drinks were on special for happy hour, but every single one of them was some sugary concoction. Figured I'd play it safe and get a mojito... but they were out of mint. He asked if I still wanted one, clearly ignoring the fact that mint is what makes a mojito work so well. I got some blueberry lemonade thing (at my chick's insistence). It was so sweet my face puckered. \n\nTime for some appetizers! The cheese steak spring rolls sounded great... except that they're egg rolls, not spring rolls (learn the difference, guys!), and they consisted entirely of meat shoved into a fried egg roll. That was it. The picture they showed made them look delicious, what with all the cheese and steak and onions and gooey innards slowly oozing out. This... this was gross. Like, something AM/PM would serve gross. \n\nThe mac-and-cheese squares were ok. Too much breading. I want to taste the mac and cheese, not all the fried crap around it. I suppose if I'd been drunken these might've been better. Keep that in mind if you plan on stopping in here.",0
1259,0,"If your looking for a good or unique burger this would be the place to go. This was my first time there and I played it safe and got the mushroom swiss burger, which was very good and tasted like a good burger you can get most places. The people I was  with though really went all out and got some of the crazy unique burgers on the menu. Like getting a friend egg on the burger. If I ever return I will def be trying something more unique. I am not usually a sweet potato fan, but the sweet potato tots were actually extremely good and the sauces paired with them really gave them a unique but awesome flavor.",3
1260,0,"***************HIT OR MISS*****************\n\nA group of us stopped to eat here since one person in a group recommended it.  If you have never been here it is inside the Mirage Hotel (the hotel itself is very nice).  \n\nThey give huge portions certainly one sandwich can feed two people and unless you are starving I suggest sharing.  \n\nWe ordered the borscht, \""creamy\"" tomato soup and chicken liver with onions.  Others in the group order the Reuben covered in cheese (not sure what's it's called if it has a name)....if you're lactose intolerant stay away from that one!!\n\nThe borscht was pretty good, though they forgot to give me the sour cream.  The chicken liver & onions were very good, though we prefer beef liver.  They were nicely cooked on the outside and the onions sweet and caramelized...ummm delishhh!!\n\nOn the other hand the \""creamy\"" tomato was more like boiled tomatoes thrown in a blender and a handful of sugar added.  DO NOT recommend this dish.  It did not have a creamy consistency, look or more important taste. \n\nThe cheese covered Reuben was ok, nothing spectacular just large portions, and they rave about the \""deli fries\"" which were ordinary French fries nothing specially to write home about. \n\nNow the cheesecake with strawberries OMG!! ah-mazing!!\n\nThe service....ehh so so.  I realize that with large groups it's more complicated but a seasoned server should have it down packed and at this point forgetting items or giving us the wrong ones is just not acceptable.  And the only reason why I know our server was season was because a friend recognized her from many times before and she herself said she'd been a food server for decades.  \n\nNow as far as the server's assistant (the drink person) she was completely unacceptable.  When we asked about a menu item her solve all answer was \""I don't know ask your server!\""...humm I'm sorry but don't you work here too?? Or do you eat at the place down the street???  Not to mention that she did not make an effort to find an answer apparently anything other than drinks is above her pay grade!!\n\nAlso, the prices are a bit steep, for a sandwich I rather spend that money on a good hamburger somewhere else. \n\nOverall, it's kind of a hit or miss, really depends on what your order.  So, all I can say is take your chance maybe you'll get lucky.  As far as we are concerned I don't think we will be eating here again, at least not anytime soon.",0
1261,0,"I don't go here often and with good reason -- there doesn't seem to be anything this bar offers that another place doesn't do better. If I wanted to dance or act crazy - there is Brothers. If I want to sit outside - I'd goto Vintage or Johnny O's. If I wanted a quieter place to sit down and talk - there is Red Shed, Segredo's(cause its usually dead) or Blue Velvet.

1263,0,My first visit tonight will be my last. Took over an hour to get a table that had been promised to be ready at 8 PM when we called to confirm at 7:30 PM for a party of 12. We didn't get seated until more than an hour passed and when seated no one came over to take drink orders. I had to go find someone for a waitress. The food took more than 30 minutes to arrive and by now it's past 9:30 PM and half the restaurant is empty. The manager came to table to apologize for the amateur service and she said she'd comp some meals or at least parts of the meals. NO SUCH COMPS WERE GIVEN and an 18% gratuity was added to all checks. I've visited many restaurants in Charlotte in 24 years of living here but this is among the top 10 worst experiences I've ever had. My impression is that no one on the staff really cared what happened to us and the manager's attitude pretty much cemented that view.,0
1264,0,Wife and I had dinner on 9/18/13. Usual service was good for the establishment. We tried the new additions to the menu. I had the Honey Pepper steak and the wife had the Honey Chicken Shrimp. The honey really overpowered the dish. The steak was cooked how I ordered. I tried the wife's shrimp and thought I was eating candy. This dish will never be ordered again. The onions and jalape\u00f1os were smothered in the honey syrup. It should have been fried and placed on the steak after it was cooked. That's how it looked on the menu. On a scale of 1-10 I rate this dinner a 2. This Applebee's is In my neighborhood and we will keep going but will not be trying any new dishes especially if honey is added.,2
1265,0,"This place is where you want to be if you value comfort and location on the Vegas Strip. The rooms are stellar with the beds and bathrooms being very comfortable. In room safe and flat screen TVs add to the quality. The hotel itself has an excellent sports book, great shopping, good food, and a fantastic theme: sexy women in lingerie dealing cards and craps! The location on the strip is prime. If you are on your first trip to Vegas and are between 21 and 30 go here no questions asked. I go to Vegas multiple times per year and always stay at Planet Hollywood. Its always a superior experience for the price.",3

1268,0,"Well.... Where to start???? I was on Fremont street for the Year of the snake celebration events and I was hungry.... I took a walk from the stage and found myself lost in a different time zone.... Did I fall through a time rift that brought me back to the early 80's hmmmm...... I like the music and the TV shows were great but I digress.\n\nNo time rift no alternate universe on Fremont Street.... Nope I was in the Paradise Buffet... A look back into a culinary error (sorry mean to say ERA) that has long past on the Vegas strip but is alive and well in on Fremont Street. \n\nAtmosphere- Interesting if you like that vintage diner feel... (yes plastic flowers and all)\n\nService- Great!!! Our server was right there as soon as I put down my fork or hit the bottom of my glass with the the following line \"" Go get some more\"" and \""Let me refill that for you\"" The Hawaiian shirts and the flowers in the hair I guess you can compare to \""flare\"" that you see at other restaurants but it just fit right in with everything else. \n\nFood- Ummm hmmmmm well It was ummm homey and not in a bad way the items on the buffet were ALL very identifiable from the iceberg lettuce salad (really) to the cold cuts (really really) to the make your own taco station. You knew what you were getting yourself into from a culinary standpoint and did not have to ask any question about what an item was. More then likely you have had it a few nights ago for dinner. \n\nAll in all great place to sit relax and enjoy some comfort buffet food that you WONT see on the Vegas strip... ANYWHERE and that is not a bad thing.",0
1269,0,"-This place has totally redeemed its name from my previous visit to the Boca Park location. Amazing pizza, to make a long story short, and a pretty decent beer selection. Even more so in the wine department, unfortunately I have not totally educated my pallate in alot of red varietals, but I know any wino would appreciate such a vast collection.\nChinedu (I hope I spelled that right) was more than willing to help me find a suitable wine, but we were kind of in a rush to visit a friend and see a show. Got to shake hands with Joe, the regional manager, if I recall correctly. The man knows what he is doing when it comes to expanding.\nThis will definitely be a new pizza spot for me, especially because they have traditional, white and pesto options.. not to mention it is so close to my work. Thumbs up, all the way around... Congrats on the new and soon to come locations :)",4

I place my order, pay and wait for my name to be called. Why is it that I need to wait 13 minutes to get a toaster nova lox and bagel sandwich (there was only 4 people in front of me in line)? Why is it that I specifically asked for my bagel to be toasted and its not? Why is it that the people in line after me get their order before me??

Lollicup is one of the few places that serves perfectly cooked boba and the drink flavors are good as well. My favorite flavor is the Taro milk tea. I wouldn't say theirs is the best I've had, but their Passion iced tea with mango jelly is pretty darn amazing. That drink will keep me coming back for more.",3

1279,0,"This was my first visit to 40 West Steakhouse. My impression upon entering the restaurant was that Montreal has finally found its place among some of the better-known steak establishments in the U.S. We were greeted by an attractive group of hostesses and were seated in a prompt and courteous manner. \n\nThe food was presented very well by our waiter, and the quality of service went downhill from there. One of the members of my party was shown a rib steak in its raw form and instead received a much less impressive and fattier version. And as if that were not enough, halfway through our meal someone decided to reduce the lighting in the restaurant by about 50%, after which we had to almost beg for a candle for our table so that we could see what we were eating.\n\nFrom a condescending response to how two members of our party requested their meat be cooked; to ignoring numerous requests for more butter; to having to hunt down a bus person to ask for fresh-ground pepper; to our request for plain water and serving us Evian instead, our waiter left the building. He definitely put a cloud over our experience. \n\nService notwithstanding, the food was absolutely delicious. My NY strip was one of the best I ever had. My brother's lamb chops were enjoyable too. \n\nI would give 4 stars for food and 2 stars for service, therefore an overall rating of 3 stars is justified in my opinion. \n\nOne small aside: the presence of a large flat-screen TV diminishes the authentic steakhouse ambience.",0
1281,0,"Given the big salon, I think your experience will be highly related to which stylist you chose. I bought a Groupon for a level 3 haircut and moisture treatment. The stylist Ken spent 5 mins for the cutting, 40 mins to blow the hair dry and chatting and forgot the moisture treatment. The technique of the haircut is so poor. There is no layer of the cutting and it is not horizontally on the same level. I think he is not serious about what he did. I will not come for the second time. MCN is much better in this sense. You should definitely try to avoid him as your stylist if you choose to go to Dean of Shadyside.",0
1282,0,"I feel like I need to give this restaurant another shot, because despite the great reviews, my experience was less than stellar. Of course, I expected a wait on a Sunday at 11:30am. No problem, the weather was beautiful and the servers brought around samples of chocolate banana nut bread, which was yummy. The wait time was about 30 minutes. \n \nHowever, once were seated, that's where things went a bit downhill.  We were seated at a tiny table in a corner RIGHT by the bathroom. Really? A table shouldn't have even been there in the first place. Not only were we subjected to people walking right up against our food while they were going to and from the restroom, there were a number of flies circling throughout our meal. Since the restaurant was packed, there was nowhere else to move.\n\nOkay.. let's just try to focus on the food and service. The service was great- very attentive, and they must have asked us if they could top off our coffee about 10 times. Toward the end of the meal, we started feeling rushed. I know they were trying to turn the table, but I hate feeling like they are ready for us to get the heck out!\n\nThe food was good, and a good value. The omelettes were nicely sized, and came with potatoes and toast for $8.99. My friend opted to get sliced bananas instead of potatoes (I know-weird), but they came with a hair attached. Yuck.  \n\nI'm not going out of my way to return, but I am not opposed to giving them another shot. Just one more, though.",0
1283,0,Went here at 1am on Black Friday. The place is pretty ghetto for being inside a casino.\n\nOxtail Soup was the only thing worth trying. Ordered the fish and chips and it was still cold on the inside. Also tried the steak and it was pretty bland. One trick pony in my opinion.,0

1286,0,"I have been trying to come to The Cornish Pasty Co for a very long time now and I was not disappointed. The food is absolutely delicious. Being from England myself I can honestly say these are the best pasties I have ever eaten. We ordered the Bangers and Mash pasty and also the Cajun Chicken pasty. Nothing short of amazing. The Bangers and Mash took me back home after the first bite, perfect sausages with great mashed potatoes with grilled onions, yummy. The Cajun Chicken was a great twist that I have never seen in a pasty. Delicious chicken with ham, bacon, and swiss cheese, oh and lets not forget the chipotle sauce to dip in. Also ordered the oven chips with cheese and jalepenos. Everything was piping hot and fresh, made right in front of you if you're at the bar. Place is nice on the inside with dim lighting, staff was great and friendly, their looks and personalities bring the place alive. Large selection of beers and wine from all over the world, no hard alcohol here. Only negatives is the no hard alcohol as I'm a Jack and coke kind of guy and the location is a little hard to find as it's in a large complex.

I then asked one more time just a ham sub with mayo and pickle. I was then told I can have a plain ham sandwich with mayo packets on the side. I had asked for pickles on it, ONCE again I was told that they can't so that... But they can give me a whole pickle.. BUT they can't cut it up. I would really love someone to example to me why they couldn't do that?! And on top of that all I got was attitude from the cashier. Great customer service, NOT! Place is a joke, hire new people. I'll be going to Jersey Mike's for now on. At least they are willing to do the little things!",0
1288,0,"I was skeptical about authentic Hawaiian food in Vegas, but Island Flavor proved to be a spot that locals could satisfy their craving at.\n\nPortions: HUGE. One plate could feed three of us had we known they were going to be so big. Kahlua pork is mild, but super tender. I could've used a bit more salt on the meat, but it was still good. Sweet and sour pork ribs were tasty but almost a little too salty. Furikake chicken was bomb. I added Sriracha and it became super bomb.\n\nMy only complaints are regarding the rice.\nBrown rice - too much water so I basically had two scoops of brown rice mush.\nFried rice - now this is where I think Island Flavor failed because their version of fried rice is basically white rice with some lapcherng and veggies doused with soy sauce. I've eaten and seen fried rice made enough to know we weren't eating fried rice. The portion was a potful. No joke.\n\nCOCO PUFFS = yum. I have no idea what the buttery yellow stuff is on top of the chocolate cream puff but it's ONO.\nMud pie = good. I liked the chocolate cacao or coffee nibs in the kona coffee ice cream. Really nice touch. Could do without the flavored syrups on the plate though.\n\nStaff were friendly even though very busy.\n\nSpam musubi was right on.

1291,0,"Seems like Monti's used to be allot better.  Last time I went, 6-5-12 for dinner, service and food quality were about 2 stars.  My prime rib tasted dry and old, the Roman Bread was 1/4\"" thick and the dough was tough, and my Baked Potato was old tasting and turning a little brown from oxidation.  The salad was OK.  The service was only fair, at best. Not what I expect for the prices they are charging.  The last couple of meals I have gotten there have been Meh, as well.  I think Monti's has become arrogant and complacent, from year of sucess, and now dosen't worry too much about maintiaining food quality or great service.  They always say there is a small wait, even if the place is empty.  I never have understood that policy.  I guess there are enough fans or new Tempe visitors to keep Monti's going, even as they severely decline in quality.",1

I don't like much else... unless it involves fruit, ice, and well...a sophisticated combination of Baileys, Guinness, and Jamison - but I am all over...yes all over - anything having to do with champagne.\n\nSo after watching the incredible Le Reve - we made our way over to Blush, with our VIP bands, to get our bubbly on.\n\nI have to admit that I didn't have high expectations for the space, so Blush exceeded any and all pre-conceived notions I had. There was plenty of room to move, good music, the bartenders and cocktail waitresses were friendly (and hot...), the space itself was glamorous and sophisticated, and as soon as we found ourselves in the picturesque and daintily lit outside patio area, some nice folks smiled at us and quickly made room on their table.\n\nIt was our first night in Las Vegas, and with our fake eyelashes batting, our brown skin hues pressed up the white chairs, and our bubbling champagne in hand - we couldn't help but bask in the sexy outdoor glow of the night. \n\nFor any girls looking for a low-key way to start the night, I couldn't recommend Blush more. Unfortunately for guys, they do charge a 30 dollar cover, which Blush, though chic and beautiful - is not worth.\n\nAlso, while you won't have to fight your way through a glazed eyed crowd, one could even remark and find fault with how mellow the crowd is/was. \n\nWhen we were there, people were evidently interested in conversing and mingling. Very few people, in fact no people were dancing, despite the quality music flowing through the lovely space. \n\nI personally loved the low-key vibe of Blush, but if you're looking for your destination Vegas night spot  full of of table top-dance moves - Blush may be too timid for your liking.",0

When we got back to the camera section, we couldn't find the model we were looking for and there was no associate around to turn to for help. I got the attention of the young man working the cell phone counter and he said he would summon someone to help us. \n\nThe associate that came to help us seemed disgruntled by the fact we needed help and wanted to know if they had they particular model we were looking for at another location (Don't even get me started on the screws he had in his ears pretending to be earrings).  This young lad was rude, unprofessional and put off a huge \""I don't want to be here vibe.\"" You know it's bad when three teenage boys, who have nothing on their minds but skateboards and girls, notice the poor attitude and lack of customer service. He eventually did let us know another Walmart location had what we were looking for, but did so with such disdain it was alarming. I can't lay all the blame on him, as I am sure he wasn't provided with a whole lot of training on how to deal with customers. You would think with the way the economy has been, companies would put a bigger focus on training their employees how to deal with the customers.\n\nWe were so put off by the poor customer service, we stopped by the Best Buy across the street. Come to find out, their price was just as good as Walmart's. I have yet to write a one-star review, but this came really close. It's hard to stay away from Walmart, because they offer almost everything, but experiences like  this make it an easy.",0

I wasn't expecting much and the only reason I decided to even give it a try is that we had a 2 for 1 coupon. It was very below average food. The only thing I enjoyed was the steamed rice and fried popcorn shrimp but that's not saying a whole lot considering these two dishes are not very hard to make at all. The eggs were terrible and desserts were not tasty at all. On top of all that, we had stomach aches afterwards. I'm sorry to say that I don't think anyone can pay me to eat here again...",0
1298,0,"We had never had persian food before, just other Mediterranean and some Middle Eastern food, which it seemed like this was a mix of those regional foods? Based on the yelp recommendations, we made sure to share our dish since it sounded like you get quite a bit of food. \n\nWe got the chicken olivea salad, which is like a chicken/tuna/potato salad, really tasty with our pita bread. It had chicken, green beans, potatoes and lots of mayo, along with tomatoes and pickles on the side. We had leftovers, so I'm making a sandwich out of it! We also shared the sultani combo which had filet mignon and ground beef kebabs. They were both really tasty, and we especially liked the filet mignon. The combo came with batsmati rice and a tomato/cucumber/onion salsa type salad that came on the side. We had the persian ice cream for dessert since we read so much good stuff about it. It was really tasty considering it's a fancy vanilla ice cream. The rose water and pistachios added a nice touch of flavor that was yummy\n\nThere was one guy working, who was basically the host, waiter, and busboy, and he did an excellent job!

Mostly take out and one dine in occasion.\n\nI've never had one of those experiences where I notice someone order AFTER me and still get their food first. Until here! \n\nI remember that occasion. We ordered a pizza, and two appetizers. Our pizza came out literally 45 minutes after ordering it, they bring the one appetizer another 5 minutes later, and then the second appetizer just about the hour mark. One of those that's it I'm leaving moments but I stuck it out. We were in there when there were maybe 2 other small parties were there so I just didn't understand. They had a lot of workers but we maybe got one refill when we asked after we ate. \n\nThere was never a \""sorry out kitchens baked up\"" or even a just plain \""sorry it's taking so long\"". That tells me they don't see a problem.\n\nHow hard is it to fry up some garlic balls to bring out as an appetizer? How about wings? That should have come out first to freaking offset the pizza wait! Restaurant and service 101!\n\nOur entire meal took almost an hour and a half. \n\nGranted the take out line started getting busy we still ordered way before it got busy.\n\nThen tonight I went and took a take out order and our crust was burnt on our pizza. \n\nSorry but that was the last straw. I just can't see myself eating here again.\n\nYes their garlic balls are good and cheap but I'll go elsewhere at all costs. \n\nTheir ordering sucks. You call and automatically get placed on hold. WHY?! I was in there and both girls did that. WHY?! They weren't even doing anything that couldn't wait!\n\nAlso the staff sucks.\n\nCustomer service and personality go along way. I don't see how that girl works there. She must be related or own the place. Dark hairs girl that is a little pale. Sorry to put her out there but she just sucks. One time she gave me a free ranch with my order but I left a tip larger than the cost of the ranch so that doesn't make up for it. \n\nThere's no appreciation of the customer. I'd rather eat where they have good service and good food as opposed to bad service and great food. \n\nThey don't give a good name to local businesses and I'd much rather eat at a big corporate chain as opposed to this place.",0

1306,0,"Items Selected:\nChocolate Chip Buttermilk Short Stack\nChallah French Toast\nBaked Apple Pancake\n\nTechnically a chain, with origins in Portland OR and the famous Walker Bros location in Wilmette IL, it was only when Groupon offered a discount that I realized Las Vegas even had an Original Pancake House and although I guess it could be said that the $8 discount was the impetus for my visit, in reality it was fond childhood memories that drew me through the doors.  Located on Fort Apache, and thus less than ten minutes from my door, it was after another long morning run that I arrived at the sizeable storefront and although the clock had just ticked past 7:15am I entered the restaurant to find the place already lively, a quartet of tables already seated while two couples before me checked in with a friendly hostess soon leading them to their seats.  Eventually finding my place at a booth best suited for four it was mere seconds before my server stopped by and with my order pre-decided based on past experience a simple request that plates arrive in two courses was granted, the long cooking time of the later assuring a fifteen minute delay between rounds.  Sipping on water as the restaurant continued to fill it would not be long before first plates arrived and although the restaurant's eponymous buttermilk batter was fluffy as ever beneath a mountain of whipped cream it was the house-baked challah that truly impressed, the exterior rendered crispy while the center was soaked in sweet custard playing counterpoint the rich egginess of soft bread.  Admittedly a substantial start, and nearly enough to use up my gift certificate, there was simply no way I was leaving Original Pancake House without ordering one of their signatures and this time opting for the Baked Apple Pancake over the Dutch Baby I'll simply say that one cannot go wrong with either, the piping hot pile of thinly sliced Granny Smith's teaming with cinnamon and sugar atop a buttery golden base proving as much a 'pie' as it does a pancake, but absolutely delicious regardless of what it is called.\n\nIndividually owned and operated but similar in menu from coast-to-coast there is simply 'something' about Original Pancake House that makes me smile - the service ever pleasant, the space always bustling, and the apple pancake always served so hot that you *know* the first bite is likely to end in a blistered mouth.  Obviously a bit more expensive than IHOP or Denny's but also using superior ingredients including 93-score butter, pure whipping cream, and free-range eggs it's good to know that every once in a while you can indeed find a taste of 'home,' even a thousand or more miles away.",4

It took over 5 minutes to get the drinks.  My husbands tea glass was completely packed with ice and 2/3 full with tea, there was so much ice that he could not even mix a sweet n low in it.

1310,0,"I suggest staying somewhere else unless you only plan to sleep in your room at night and aren't looking for anything but a bed.  The only reason I give the place three stars is because the dealers should get five stars.  \n\nRegarding the hotel, after a long and somewhat confusing walk to the check-in counter from the taxi drop-off, there was a long line to check into the hotel.  Once through the line, I was notified my room was not ready because check-in is not until 4:00 p.m.  Of course, they were happy to find me a room that would be ready for a $20 early check-in fee.  I opted for a $10 per night room upgrade and they waived the early check-in fee.  \n\nThe room was below the standards of an average Holiday Inn Express (and remember, this is the upgrade).  The TV was small and they only offered about a dozen channels.  The shower had weak water pressure.  At least the bed was comfortable.  Overall, though, I suggest spending a little more and staying at Harrah's.  \n\nRegarding the casino, this was much better.  While it may lack flash, it had great dealers and pit workers.  Throughout the night, the dealers are celebrity impersonators and work very hard make your experience a good one. Look for Kesha and Jake (Blues Brothers) and tip them well.  They made the stay worthwhile.   The servers were also always nearby and quick here - much better than Harrah's. \n\nBottom line: Stay at Harrah's and play the tables at the IP.",2

1314,0,"This is a much delayed review. I got married in April 2014 and since it was just a simple ceremony with family members and a few closed friends, I didn't plan on getting a bouquet. My husband told me that I should get one so I have something in my hands. I went in to the shop around February, 2 months before to our big day, picked out a small calla lily bouquet and asked a specific ribbon color (tan in satin material) and was told it could be matched. The small bouquet which only has like a handful of flowers, cost $90. I thought, that's expensive but I didn't want to run around town for a bargain and sucked it up and paid for it based on the awards and reviews. I even sent email with photos of my wedding shoes so the arrangement person knows exactly what color I am talking about. \n\nThen, the day came, my husband picked up the bouquet while I got ready in the hotel room. He brought it back and boy was I upset. The ribbon was brown. Brown. Dark brown. Not tan. I would not have been upset if the ribbon was camel, tan, whatever. But it was brown. It was not anywhere close to the photos I had sent to the shop. \n\nIn hindsight, I wished I had gone and picked it up myself so I could have had it fixed and instead I had my husband to do it and he had no idea what the hell he was looking at. \n\nIf I ever get flowers again for whatever reason, I am definitely requesting a trial so I know what to expect.",0
1315,0,"I had dinner here last night because the conference dinner menu was southwest bbq and really thought that the resort could not pull off authentic bbq without a decent fire pit.   Went over to the Stonegrill, was seated immediately at a nice 2 top outside by the lawn and lagoon pool.   They had a decent by the glass wine list at reasonable prices considering the property. \n\nMy server Katie was knowledgeable attentive and made for a pleasant dining experience.   I started with the chili lime calamari with a cilantro crema dipping sauce.  The calamari was lightly coated tempura style and just kissed by the deep fryer so it was tender.  The bottom of the cast iron serving dish was lined with parchment paper which was oil laden and not a pleasant sight.  Glad that oil missed my tummy but it was off putting presentation. \n\nNext was a small farmers greens salad that looked beautiful and tasted wonderful.   A great recovery from the oily parchment paper.   It was lightly dressed with a jalape\u00f1o olive oil vinegarette.  Nice little spice kick.\n\nFor the main,  I had the braised short ribs with carrots on a bed of celeriac potato puree.   It was a good amount of meat and it was fork tender the way short ribs should be and succulent!  However there were only 3 tiny carrot slices (hhmm) and the puree barely peeked out from under the short rib.\n\nFor desert I had the apple crostada with a tres Leche sauce on the side.  I would say it was the best executed dish of the whole dinner.  \n\nOverall, for the price the presentation needs to be of a better quality and the side quantities need to be more generous however the dinner was tasty and would probably go back again when visiting this property.",2
1316,0,"After 5 hours of nonstop driving from SD to Las Vegas, the fam decided to stop by the \""asian\"" area and get some food before we checked in at our hotel. Bad choice.\n\nWhen you first walk in, you are greeted with a wall of awards, recognitions, and accolades from websites and critics. I've been to a Sam Woo BBQ before, and this was uncommon. I thought it would lead to a good start, I was wrong.\n\nThose awards were issued in 2001, and boy, did they really change the restaurant till now. I ordered the roast pork and roast duck rice dish. Just to let you know, the prices for the food served here are double the price if the Sam Woo back in SD ($7-$10, Las Vegas Sam Woo $7-$20). Came pretty fast. The duck was OK, but the pork was really fatty. In fact, it was almost ALL fat. Not too good.\n\nMy dad, on the other hand, ordered the Singapore noodles.

I spoke to Tyler who looked my account up while I was on the phone and found that my battery was covered, but that Valvoline no longer stocked that battery. He assured me they could replace it with a different one, but it would have to be ordered in which would take a couple of days. No problem for me and saved me a couple of hundred dollars.  He later called me to let me know when it was in. I then met Tyler when I came in to have it replaced and get my oil changed. He was just as organized, personable and efficient as he'd been on the phone. There are a lot fewer Valvoline's in AZ than in MN, so it is so nice that one is somewhat conveniently located to me and supplies the same exceptional customer service and friendliness. Even more, the owner of the Valvoline called me himself, as a random customer service check, and was also exceptionally nice and caring.  It's been more than six months, but my experience as Valvoline remains the best customer service experience I have had in the 2.5 years I have been in Phoenix.  That one person, Tyler, took control of my issue and handled it flawlessly from beginning to end over the course of less than a week seems to be a rare thing in AZ (much more common in the Midwest - so I am still adjusting expectations) and I remain so impressed, that as a client, it was all handled with minimum effort, follow-up or inconvenience on my part, that I wanted to write this review in the hope you can have a great customer service experience as well!",3

We came for a couples massage and I think each of us would highly recommend the practitioners. Probably one of the best massages I've ever had.\n\nTwo negatives:\n\n1. The price for a massage was reasonable, but they did not tell us that the \""water circuit\"" was an additional charge of $35 per person until we checked out. (If you just want to attend the spa, and don't have any services it costs $55.) So be sure that you know the full price when you sign up.\n\n2. The spa facilities are very cool and the design is modern: There are lots of areas to relax and chill out in between steam room, sauna, and hot tub, etc.  But the locker room is too minimalist. The lockers are small and there aren't adequate  areas to lay your belongings while you change. The real complaint, however, is that there are no products other than shampoo and conditioner. It has been my experience that most spas provide an ample supply of products (razors, shaving cream, deodorant, etc.). So bring your own. And bring your own shoes - the robes are nice, but they don't provide shower shoes. \n\nI still recommend the experience. It is a unique and cool facility, but know what you're buying first.",0

Your meal comes with beans and rice.\nI had fish taco's that were so good I stuffed myself and ate it all!  My husband had enchilada's and they boys had beef & pork burrito's.

1334,0,"I came here as part of a Girls' Night Out package, so I understand this won't be available to everyone...

The 10 oz. filet could have easily been that much on its own, and it was phenomenal. The meat was flavorful and tender, and we hardly even used the sauces they gave us. We couldn't finish everything they gave us; if I wasn't signed up for a prix fixe menu, I would definitely go for the filet and maybe a side of green beans. It'd be enough food, and it's incredibly tasty!",4

Their food is sub par and dirty. Now all that aside I had an issue with them messing up an order and called in to ask them to fix this, the girl over there was rude and defensive to my claims that the wrong toppings were placed on the burger we had ordered. I specifically said no tomato and she specifically repeated that back to me as we'll so I know it wasn't her fault. She passed me over to the manager who was really mad that he had to come to the phone and explained to him that the person is allergic to tomatoes and that we'd appreciate it if they could send us a new one...he said rudely \""no just scrape the fu@$ng tomato off. I told him that she's allergic and that there is still tomato all over even if we scrape it off. He said too fu&$% bad we're not sending you anything. I asked him why he was so mad and he said cause I'm fu%^# busy cooking wtf do you want and hung up. NOW THAT'S CUSTOMER SERVICE!!

You can't make reservations despite what their (infuriating and confusing) automated answering machine said.\n\nOk, no problem.  I'm willing to wait for good food and to try a new place.  Luckily, we snagged two seats at the bar within 10 mins.  It was all downhill from here...\n\nCocktails were awful.  They don't carry Tito's, so I went with a Stoli (up with a twist).  Not good.  The perfect vodka martini should be ice cold with shards of ice crystals and citrus oils.  Mine was cold-ish... and had a thick awkward corkscrew of rind balanced on the rim.  Whatever.  We moved on to the specialty \""cockytails.\""  DIABETES. seriously. we tried the blueberry skinny tea and cool as a cucumber and they both tasted like sugar water.  The one/only good thing was the jalapeno bacon moonshine.  We took shots of that and I would recommend.  Very jalapeno-y and bacon-y and... yah, first time I've had a savory shot and I liked it.\n\nFood was mediocre to awful.  We were about to order the fried okra when the people next to us said it was bad.  My friend tried some of the neighbor's  -- mushy and bland and gross.  Biscuit was undercooked and unimpressive. Appalachian egg rolls were dripping with oil, yet not crispy (I imagine the oil wasn't hot enough), and just meh.  Shrimp and grits were fine... but nothing special.  The fried egg and bacon sandwich with home fries were also fine... but it was no different from what I could have made in 5 mins. on any given weekend morning.\n\nService was obviously lacking because the place was slammed and we were at the bar.  Let's go with \""N/A\"" here.\n\nWe opted to skip dessert.

Finally after at least 5 minutes I was addressed and I placed my order. I couldn't tell if the server was unfriendly, if it was merely a cultural thing, or if he just had trouble understanding me. Anyway since I'm giving the benefit of the doubt here, I increased my ranking by one star.\n\nI ordered the beef noodle soup and it was terrible - too spicy and the beef had a weird taste to it. Usually after I leave establishments one of the employees will either say thank you, have a good day or something, but not in this place.\n\nA few things to take into account are that the employees were college age and it was pretty close to closing time so that could have impacted the level of service.

1346,0,"Waiting for my friends at the bar located near their entrance, I had a good feeling about this place.  It had all the bells and whistles of a nice upscale restaurant with a friendly bartender to start.  Unfortunately my good feeling about this place was short lived as our party was seated.\n\nOur reservation was for 9:15 PM Sunday night.  We didn't get seated until 9:45 PM despite having our whole party there by 9:00 PM.  I didn't care too much for this considering the place was moderately busy on a holiday weekend, and we weren't on a strict schedule.  So I let this roll easily off my back.\n\nAs we were seated, we were greeted by our waiter who was terribly unenthusiastic about his job.  He was considerate about asking  for food allergies.  Beyond that, all levels of consideration or customer service for that matter stopped there.  Granted, he warned us that our food would come out infrequently, but little did we know it would delay our dinner by over an hour.  A little honesty would have been greatly appreciated.  It took forever for most of our food to come out.  We didn't have utensils or place settings even after our food was delivered.  My friend even asked for the manager, to complain about our horrible service, or lack thereof.  The manager's response was something like: \""Things are are a bit backed-up, we'll give you free dessert.\""  Now, I don't care how backed-up your kitchen is... that's still no excuse for horrible and incompetent service!  Dessert only puts a band-aid on a broken arm... why the hell do restaurant managers  do this?  We are not looking to get something free, we just want to make sure they get their act together... and fast!\n\nOur original waiter rarely came to our table after we ordered our food.  Another waitress came to our aid who was very helpful and attentive to our needs.  She was very friendly and courteous, it's unfortunate she wasn't our original waiter because this review would've been completely different.\n\nOur unpleasant waiter did the weirdest thing.  As my friend was talking to the manager, being very open about our waiters horrible service, our waiter stood by our table as he refolded all our used napkins, tossing them onto our table.  Yes, our used clothe napkins.  Who does that?  In front of a party that is pretty disgusted by you no less.  It seemed as if he knew he was already in hot water and didn't give a rats-ass about making up for it.  In addition, he circled the portion of our bill they decided to discount for the unsatisfied service in a stuck-up negative manner.  In hind site, my friend said we should have taken that same pen, in front of our waiter, and scratched out his tip!  Of course, we're better than that.\n\nThe food is the only reason why this place is not getting a single star. The food was actually quite good with a variety of unique asian-fusion plates.  I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki (exotic right?) which was much more than I bargained for.  For such a simple dish, it had a variety of unique flavors with a side of extras that complimented each bite.  My friends ordered an array of food that looked just as good, and was commented on just the same.\n\nFor me, customer service will make or break any experience, no matter how good the food is.  In this case, their service failed horribly.  Our party ended up with a waiter that was a few cans short of a six pack regarding personality, who would probably fare better as a Chippendale's greeter than a restaurant waiter.  I hope management recognizes this and hires waiters that are actually qualified to interact with human beings.",0

Not sure if this is where I would go on a diet, but needless to say, I am not. The bar is well stocked (and always cheap domestic beer specials), but not always with the most enjoyable of a crowd.

1349,0,"I have been here a few times now and I likely won't go back for a while. The food is really very good, but, the service is slow. The first time we went, it was around 1 pm on a Saturday. The patio was full so we were fine sitting inside. The bartender ended up serving us and she couldn't have been more annoyed or stressed out. She rushed us and never even smiled. After waiting about 15 minutes for our food, she told us the kitchen was backed up and it would be another 5-10 minutes. It ended up being another 15-20. They slightly messed up the order, but, overall the food was great! The second time I went we sat outside. Our server was so sweet, but, again seemed stressed. We waited at least 35 minutes for our food (party of 4 people) and when it came my order was wrong. I sent it back, waited another 5-10 minutes, and then got my food. It was delicious, again, but didn't feel worth it since we waited for so long. Our server did thank us for our patience when we left. A third time I went I just had drinks. It was fine, but, slow service, again. \n\nI think this place will be great when they figure out their staffing. I will go back again, but, I will give them some time to figure it out.",2

The bartenders are great and very much good at sitting and talking to you and remembering your name and shaking your hand when you come in. The things that give it only 3 stars are the PRICE OF DRINKS, the gaming in the top of the bar and the never ending \""soft openings\"". I wish they would just have the dadgum grand opening already!! The drinks are twice the price of the drinks at Artifice 3 blocks away and the table top gaming is irritating because it's what I DON'T want to see in an artsy fartsy bar in the Arts District. They are just in the way of putting your drinks down and all the times I've been in there I've not once seen someone playing on them. I usually bring friends in here to show them how awesome it is in there, have one drink ( because of the high prices) and then head on down the road to Artifice or Dino's where my booze money can go 2 to 4 times the distance. I would give this place a SOLID 5 stars if they would do away with the gaming and lower the drink prices. Just saying my piece Mike and Sam, you guys have a great bar.

This place houses 3 restaurants (347 Grill, Luxe and Cones Caf\u00e9) The 347 Grill and the Luxe share the same kitchen, so you'll get the same food quality. The biggest difference between the two is the 347 Grill is family friendly and the Luxe is for adults only with more emphasis on the drinks as the bar anchors this lounge/restaurant. My group ate at the Luxe due to the wait at Grill 347; the food was okay nothing to scream about good enough to keep the night festive, the price points were dead on. I had the Mediterranean salad which was well balanced and good in size however I wish the cucumbers were more freshly cut.  My husband ordered the Honey BBQ wings which were good in size, well sauced and crunchy, yum! The other people in my party all enjoyed their food as well.

For an additional $2.50 you can upgrade to the \""Star Class\"" area upstairs and view your movie minor free with drink and waiter service, score!!! I didn't get a chance to bowl at the \""Tin Pens\"" bowling alley but next time I definitely will. The Arcade was decent.

With a greasy ranchero sauce and a flour burrito wrapped around the grilled soft tofu this was uplifting in the morning. I had cheese on mine (oh my) but you could easily veganize this without. \n\nI thought that was as lucky as I could have gotten...and then I tried their Medium Red Salsa (note: they have a pretty decent salsa bar). Heaven on earth. The combination of the tofu taco and the salsa set the tone for my gastronomical adventure on the trip to come. I also needed a pack of gum right after.\n\nTheir menu of tacos/burritos/bowls is extensive and there are many veggie options that include tofu. The people working here were very sweet and helpful. Note that the taco I had was rather greasy and I didn't necessarily like that part of it. \n\nConsidering the airport generally sucks for any meal option for the vegetarian/vegan, 360 definitely helps even out the equilibrium. In relation to other airport establishments I'd give 360 a 5 star review. But in relation to other restaurants, 360 would have to get a 3. \n\nI have to say that my tofu breakfast taco with a Caramel Macchiato from Starbucks made this flight a lot more bearable. \n\n(360 is located near the B gates - Southwest)",2

Unlike the vast majority of bars in town, this is not a corporate operation run by MBAs from afar.  Instead, the eponymous McMullans are there every day.  Furthermore, they are extremely involved in the community.  Their \""St. Baldrick's\"" charity drive raises donations in six figures for children with cancer every year.  McMullan's Pub features all the beverages that you would expect in an Irish joint with the food being a definite step above usual bar fare. (I'm partial to the fish & chips, myself.)

1363,0,"I really wish I was writing a \""Hooray!\"" but I'm not. The Uptown location wasn't my first rodeo with the Mushroom and won't be my last.  The Mushroom is usually solid artisan pizza, just not this time.  I started visiting different Mellow Mushrooms about ten years ago.  The Jerk pizza has always been my \""go-to.\""\n\nI went to the Uptown location for a business lunch.  Not too bad.  We got seated in less than a minute.  The menu didn't have my favorite, but I'm the type of person that is willing to try many different things.  So I asked our waitress for a recommendation and was led to the Mellowterranean.  A grilled chicken pizza with onions, roasted red peppers, black olives, chives, feta, mozzarella and tzatziki sauce.  Sounds like a homerun eh?\n\nTwo things to note about this pizza:\n\nGigantic roasted red pepper laid out on the pizza.  This isn't convenient to eat, and the texture and amount just make this strange and unappealing.\n\nSecond, yes, the tzatziki is pretty tasty, but I found myself using it to cover up the other tastes.  A condiment should compliment, not be needed to cover up the  the rest of the dish.\n\nLastly, the cheese bread appetizer.  Oh how I laughed.  The look on my associate's face was priceless.  To quote, \""Is this cheese on hot-dog buns?\""  Lol...I almost spit water out my nose when he said that.  To be fair, what we were brought, looked nothing...and I do mean...nothing...like the picture you see on Yelp.

Because I know the Mellow Mushroom as a whole.  I know that this is the only experience I've had that was disappointing.  Maybe it was an off day, maybe it was blah blah blah.

Even after showing him our passes, he had the nerve to ask for 20 bucks per person so we can cut to the front. No thanks, we were literally 7 people away from the front of the line and the last thing I wanted to do is give the D-bag any money.\n\nWe waited in line for about 10 minutes and got in. I was a bit surprised to see how crowded the place was. The DJ was just okay. He played a mix of old school hip-hop and classic clubbing songs. There are two bars and a decent size dance floor. They had a couple go-go dancers there too. Drinks were pricey, but they are strong. I paid 30 bucks for a Whiskey (Jim Beam)/Coke and Gin (Mystery clear bottle)/Tonic.\n\nThere are a lot of aggressive chubby girls here. My buddy was dancing near platform; a little too close to a group of drunk jolly girls at a bachelorette party. They devoured him like a free T-bone steak.

After watching my buddy fend for his life, we decided it was time to go and grab a pizza. \n\nAs we left, this a-hole from behind the VIP area shoves my friend to the ground. No reason.

None of the ice cream, fountain, or dessert choices were in the menu we wer given and our server didn't know what wet fries were.  My husband's cheeseburger was fine, but nothing to get excited about.\n\nI didn't see a jukebox and the wait staff all wore jeans and T-shirts.  How is that \""Delux\""?  Maybe it's that they serve beer and have a TV with football on?  I have no idea.  Regardless, we won't be back.",0
1371,0,"We came here on a Wednesday night and waited for about 20 minutes and I wish we would have just gone to the buffet!\n\nAfter eating our appetizer which came out in a timely manner, we waited another 20 minutes for one of our two entrees.  While waiting, we noticed that there was a large Chinese family who sat 10 minutes after we did. They placed their order in their native tongue to the waitress and received all of their order. We were really disappointed, we had anticipated eating the sweet sour chicken with the chicken chow mein. Our waittress never came to apologize that the chicken chow mein wastaking longer than anticipated. When we brought it to the attention of the manager, she said some dishes take longer and my hubby pointed out that the Chinese family had chow mein orders, too, and she couldn't answer us!\n\nSo as we sat, we noticed that customers who spoke Chinese, had special treatment over other nationalities. We talked to a European couple next to us, and they had noticed the same trend. I would be interested to know if this happend to others?\n\nOH, and the food??? I would give it 3 stars!! Had better, elsewhere!",0
1373,0,"Top Chef: Tom Colicchio, Head Judge, Seasons 1-5\n\nHere's my beef with chain restaurants started by people who are looking to capitalize on being well known (Take note Wolfgang)...your \""big name\"" is a double edged sword.  On one hand, you're hoping to draw me in to your low-end restaurant because it's Tom Colicchio's place and I've had good experience in your high-end place.  With that, though, comes the expectation on my part that you won't serve food that isn't of an appropriate quality to be associated with your name.  \n\nI was sorely disappointed by my visit to 'wichcraft.  I mean, I'm not expecting a sandwich place to be a complete gourmet dining experience, but I judge it as a sandwich place, so its possible to get 5 stars \""as a sandwich place'.  'wichcraft left a lot to be desired.  The space, in a big Vegas \""strip mall\"" known as the shops at the MGM or whatever, was not that inviting.  The sandwich, though was bad.  The idea (pork and cabbage) was good, but there was little filling inbetween two slices of very stale bread.  Tom, if this was your elimination challenge, I would have told you to pack your knives.",0

1376,0,"C'mon Yelpers! 4 stars?! No way, jose. This place is nothing special and I suggest, if you are looking for a nice local place to eat in Mesa, you MOVE ON! Initially we wanted to try the little bar next door, but being New Year's Day, it was closed so we settled for this place. We walked into a dingy looking restaurant with old, dusty pictures and knick-knacks nailed to the walls and when we were seated, our server was short with us as if they were about to close and she didn't want us there. We all ordered some beer and I opted for the mug to pour mine out of the bottle. When I received it, however, I opted not to pour it into the mug afterall  because it was so dirty and cloudy that the very thought of drinking out of it was repulsing. \n\nI wasn't very hungry so I figured the potato skins would be a nice smaller meal but boy was I wrong! I was served 2 full sized russet potatoes, halved and carved out for the cheese and toppings. There was so much cheese on these potatoes that I literally had to take 3/4 of it off just to enjoy the potato itself. Also, they were so greasy that even in the short time we were sitting there the grease was piling up on top of the cheese. Did they even strain the bacon bits? I don't think so... Needless to say, I only ate one and lost my appetite. Also to be noted, the silverware was all spotty and looked like they hadn't seen the inside of a dishwasher/sanitizer in quite some time.\n\nThe only reason I gave this place 2 stars instead of 1 is because in our rush to get the heck out of there, I left my debit card on the table and the waitress chased us outside to return it. I was incredibly thankful for that!",0

The only area of the club that was open was the outdoor patio upstairs. So you would have to try and venture through the crowd of older people, composing of cougars and manthers to find some socialization. Only one bar open which was extremely overwhelmed as you can figure.... really disappointed and haven't returned since!",0

So we moved to the other kiosk where there were two sales representatives helping one lady.\n\nSurely they could have taken some time out to assist me?\n\nNope.  The dynamic duo refused to even look my direction as I waited at the counter patiently for five minutes for someone to at least speak to me.\n\nFive.\n\nMinutes.\n\nI finally had it and went to Sears Grand where people at least responded to you.\n\nGreat quality clothing, but some of the sales representatives obviously need a lot of work in the training department.",0

The end result is the closest thing to heaven.",3
1381,0,I really dont care how they got 4 stars. But if i can give a negative star i will do it and a couple of times. First of all service is horrible. We order a salty lemonade and  thai tea. After 5 minutes some one comes to the table and just said no more lemonade. So after 5 minutes more we called the waiter and asked about the thai tea. Like they had no clue we order the thai tea. Im from long beach ca. Many good pho restaurants there for me to be able to compare good service and great food. The pho was not the best.,0
1382,0,"If you're looking for some good reviews you'll have to keep looking. \n\nI have been here for a year and a half. Since selling this place and becoming The Huntington Apartments this community's level of quality has significantly dropped. \n\nThe office employees are rude, unorganized, and far from helpful. There is a bug problem that they cannot get fixed in multiple apartments. Their organization is so bad that they can't even keep up with the pest control company's schedule. We have had missed appointments, and not been ready due to miscommunication on their side. \n\nI would not recommend this place to anybody period. We do have community dumpster divers that make their rounds every morning at 6 AM however. \n\nThere are police here non stop because of the amount of crime and disorderly conduct from some of the life forms that live here. Its a complete disaster. No matter how much painting they do around here there is no covering up poor quality living or customer service.

I would not recommend this place to any friend and will certainly not be coming back.,0
1386,0,"A collection of Art, Music, Food, Drink, and good times.....First Friday is a monthly event held in the Downtown Las Vegas arts district.  I'm not sure if you can call it a 'district', but it's the closest thing Vegas has to what outsiders and new residents refer to as 'culture'.  The streets are blocked off and food vendors, art vendors, galleries, and music stages pepper the surrounding area......think of a massive block party or small festival.\n\nI enjoy coming down here with the family from time to time to check out the scene.  It gets really crowded, so it's difficult to really appreciate the art if you're into a more quiet and calm setting like I am.  One First Friday I saw a guy smoking inside the Arts Factory gallery.....that's crazy, the smoke can ruin the artwork!  Of course, nobody said anything to him.....and when I mentioned it, he gave me a \""who the F___ are you?!\"" look and walked away.  *sigh*  Some people come to First Friday for the party and not the art.....that's cool, but not really my style.\n\nThere's a lot of local musicians represented down here and a few stages where they perform.....it's kind of cool to see local bands perform since there aren't too many places in Vegas to listen to them.  There's usually a few food trucks and concession stands as well as restaurants down here.  We rarely eat at the event though as the lines can get very long and we don't really enjoy our meals when there's nowhere to sit and enjoy the food.  Definitely worth a trip if you've never been before though.\n\nSome TIPS:\n\n- Parking is very difficult to find.  There is paid valet parking at the Arts Factory on the corner of Charleston & Main St, but it fills up quickly.  Street parking close to the event is sometimes hard to find too.....my recommendation is to get there early or be patient to find a spot.\n\n- Wear comfortable shoes.  The First Friday event covers a few city blocks, so if you want to get the full experience be prepared to walk.\n\n- Bathrooms are a premium.  Because of the large crowds, expect long waits at the restroom.  The Arts Factory has one, some of the smaller galleries around the area won't let you use their private bathroom....keep that in mind.\n\n- If you bring your kids, make sure you keep an eye on them.  It's easy to lose them in the crowd and remember that you're on the streets of Downtown Las Vegas.....not a cool place to lose your kid at night.\n\nOverall, it's a pretty cool experience if you know what to expect.\n\nReturn Factor - 80%",4
1387,0,"Worst service EVER! We sat down at a dirty table (because all the tables were dirty) around 12:15 pm. We ordered margaritas on the rocks WITH salt. We got no salt so we waited another 5-10 mins for our salted margs. Then we waited for our order to be taken for about another 10-15 mins while our server was standing next to the kitchen. Well, we ordered and it was NOW 1:57pm and our food was still not to our table. One of us had ordered nachos and at 1:57 they came to tell us they were out of tortilla chips! Are you joking???? That's something they should have known from first hand! I will NEVER go back! I've worked in restaurants since I was 15 and I've never seen any sort of thing like this before!

My favorite pasty is the Lovely Bit of Salmon, and it sure is ... well ... lovely. I don't know how they manage to get so much delicious into a little pastry pocket. I was afraid the whole thing would taste fishy, but it was perfectly balanced with seasonings, asparagus and a little bit of potatoes. My husband's tried four or five different pasties and loved them all. \n\nWe've even gotten them to go, and they're still great. We like bringing out-of-town friends here since it's a unique little place with great food and lots of character. I'd love to try one of the desserts, but I usually only finish half my dinner pasty and have no room!",4

1395,0,"I should have know from the get-go I wasn't going to be a fan of the rumor. Rumor has it, the service sucks! I'll go easy on them because I'm pretty this was the first day on the job for the girl who had checked me in. \nTo start off let me inform you that self-parking is limited to maybe 15 spaces (guestimate). They offer free valet which is nice but ultimately it could be a hassle when the poor guy has more than one car coming at a time. I got around the system by just telling them I was going to park in the back and luckily they would just wave me through. The valet guys do come in handy though when you need a cab. They will flag one down for you. Believe me, you'll need a cab. Driving in Vegas is a pain and unfortunately the Rumor is about a mile off the strip, in the heat that's WAY too far to walk. Including tip each trip to the strip will cost you about 10$. Not too bad.\nBooked through hotels.com and have never had a problem with fees or taxes before because it's always been right there in black and white. No surprises. Here I go arriving at the Rumor after a 4 hour drive and as a welcome gift they inform me there's a hold of $75 per night for incidentals and what not. I was not happy about that at all but what are you going to do? I wouldn't be able to check in unless I paid the fee. We got that out of the way and get the keys to our room. You walk through an open courtyard where the pool, cabanas, hammocks, and plenty of tables and seating is available to you. It was HOT like Vegas is so the fact that you have to go outside to get to your room was not something I looked forward to. \nI get to our room and, nope it's not our room at all. I booked a deluxe 2 queen and they sent me to a room with a single bed. It was a beautiful room but not what I paid for. I walk back through the stinky hallway, down the open air staircase and through the courtyard to inform them of their mistake. It was an easy fix and fortunately the correct room was on the same floor and building so I didn't have to haul my luggage up another set of stairs. I get our room, the right one and guess what? The keys don't work. Get a sneaky suspension that they didn't trade them out when I handed them the keys to the wrong room. I go to the room with the king bed and the keys open it up. By this point I was sweaty, tired, grumpy, and irritated. I go alllllll the way back to the lobby once again and the girls who had helped me the first 2 times were busy on the phone so I nice man helped me out. He programmed my keys with the right code and that was the end of it. \nThey did send some champagne to our room to apologize and made a courtesy call which I appreciate. I would have rather them remove the 11.99 a night \""resort\"" fee than a free cheap bottle of champagne. I don't even drink champagne. Whatever I guess it's the thought that counts. I understand that mistakes happen but after reading other reviews it seems as though they happen A LOT at the Rumor. \nHigher rating simply because the room IS beautiful. There's a seperate living room area with its own tv and the bathroom is perfect! There's a rain style shower head that I LOVED! The sink was a little strange and definitely not made with short people in mind. The room was spacious and super clean. I would stay again just because the room is perfect and there's no way you'd get a room like that on the strip for the price I paid. \nCheck out was easy enough, there's was a pretty big line and the man in the front didn't ask me how my stay was. I don't know why that bothered me, I must just be picky. \nBTW it's been a couple days since I checked out and their still holding on to my $150 incidentals charge. Maybe that's just my bank processing the whole thing, I really hope so at least .",0

1397,0,"One of my favorite used bookstore. The space is a little too large for the amount of stuff they stock, but the ambiance is very laid back. The store owner is good-naturedly proprietary about her books, and the staff is refreshingly unobtrusive. They stock a limited amount of cheap vintage records and some eclectic tarot decks (all of which are sealed and unused). Cool art and design books, as well as an expansive occult, sci-fi, and history section. They have a separate bookshelf toward the front of the store full of first editions, signed and rare books; however, most of them are overpriced - I recommend Academy Fine Books if rare is what you're looking for. My only complaint is that some of the books are superficially evaluated by the buying staff; consequently, on more than one occasion I have read the first two chapters of a book and had the binding completely disintegrate. Overall, a cool place to spend an afternoon shopping for some unusual finds.",3

I have been to several places on Mill that I like and several that I dislike. For those reasons, I am giving it a solid three stars. \n\nI like restaurants such as Canteen, Cafe Boa, Gordon Beirsch, Rula Bula, La Bocca and a couple others. I'm not a fan of any of the bars on Mill but was and would be if I was still in college or in that mind set. If I was going to visit a bar on Mill, I would go to the Big Bang piano bar for some live piano music, but be warned that it gets really crowded. I like that Tempe Town Lake is near the Mill District and they host lively concerts, block parties and races. They also have sail boating and paddle boating. And finally, I like that Mill Ave has a lively vibe where I know that no matter when I visit Mill, it was always have a group of interesting visitors. \n\nI don't like how dirty, crowded, rowdy and out of control Mill can get on any college game day or at night. I try to avoid Mill at night at all costs because like I mentioned above, I'm not college age anymore. If you go to Mill, I suggest you go during the day or if you go at night, be prepared.",0

I was happy with a below $100 bill every month & never had any outages.  Fast forward to the past couple of years & I've had outages out of the blue, significant rate increases, locked into two different year contracts, only to have my bill stand at a whopping $141 every month.  When calling to report outages / issues, I get the run around & a \""few days out\"" scheduled appointment.  As far as trying to get a better deal on my service...I'm always told, \""there aren't any promotions available to you right now\"".\n\nBuyer's remorse? You bet.",0
1416,0,"We stayed here in May 2009, and we are going back to Montreal this May, but are staying somewhere less expensive with a bigger kitchenette in the same area. \n\nThere were four of us who had booked a room for a music festival we flew to Montreal to see, and we all showed up with our laptops so we can stay in touch back home (cuz what is a vacation without work?) However \""Complimentary High Speed internet\"" does not mean high speed wi-fi, so we had to take turns plugging our laptops in or dragging our shit into the lobby, which was the one place where the wi-fi actually worked (even though it was super slow, high-speed my ass!) The \""Fitness Centre\"" consisted of a treadmill, a bike and some weights, which looked as though they had all been purchased in the 70's, and since the room had no windows you could open, it got really stuffy, really fast. \n\nI think my favourite part of our week-long stay though was the housekeeping. Now, I don't mean to blame the housekeepers, but since the hotel had given out discounts for all the out-of-town people who were staying there for festival, you would think they would not wake us up at the ungodly hour of 8am, especially since the festival went until 3am, not to mention any afterparties... In any case, we went to the front desk to see about getting a \""do not disturb sign\"" and they told us they didn't have any. So we decided to draw a picture of us sleeping and turn it into a home-made sign. Magically, a \""do not disturb\"" sign appeared on our door handle the next morning! Hallelujah! We were safe to sleep in for the rest of the trip!  \n\nThe hotel did offer a complimentary breakfast, if you were able to drag your hungover ass down to the lobby before 10am, and honestly free doesn't always = good. Only two of the four of us were able to swallow our liquid dinners long enough to run downstairs, fill up a plate, throw it in the fridge and run back to bed, but most of the time it wasn't really worth it, unless you wanted to try and strike up a conversation with some of the other zombies who were staying for the festival too. I should have just stashed some cereal or granola bars in the hotel room. \n\nI will give the hotel props for storing our luggage on our checkout day since our flight was in the afternoon and not in the morning, I really did appreciate that. I guess the reason I am only giving this three stars is because it was pretty pricey, even split four ways, and as someone who has travelled a lot, I have experienced better.",0

1418,0,Great room and even better in room dining staff. Check in line was a little long but everything else was easy thanks to the technology available (TV check out from room). Valet was easy and quick service each morning. I would stay again or recommend to others.,3
1419,0,"Wouldn't know about the food.  After waiting for 10 minutes for the girl to go back and forth several times to help the lady in-front of us with no resolution, I asked to be sat at a booth to which she had to go once again and ask her manager, Thomas if she could sit us at a larger table since it was the only booth available.  He refused to let us sit there so we ended up leaving.  Probably best because with the slowness and incompetence from the hostess and the utter lack of care for making customers welcome and catering to them, I would have hated to have to endure a whole dinner there.\n\nOn a good note, we drove down the road to Burger King and got much better service way faster.",0

1424,0,"There is one major problem with the light rail...it is not outside my front door, and I demand this change. Given that I have no ability to build my own tracks, I think this means the problem might be me and my Scottsdale ghetto home.  I guess this means I need to move or get a second degree in engineering.\n\nThe trains are fabulously clean. I haven't seen such well cared for trains since Germany and this one really odd dream. Also, the odd character to average character ratio is quite low in comparison to cities like NY, Boston, and SF. It doesn't hurt that the trains look like some kind of futuristic transportation from Total Recall. I'd like to see at least one train go all black with 24\"" rims so I could roll into CenPho in style. Still, I am happy to roll in sea foam blue/green into all the best areas in Tempe, Downtown Phoenix, Central Ave, and even Mesa (right, as if there is a \""best area\"" in Mesa). \n\nApparently the trains go west beyond Central Ave too and are heading further west at some future date, but I am fearful of heading west to places that end in \""ale\"" (mostly because I hear the chance of being attacked by a chain restaurant are quite high). \n\nFairs are great too...$1.75 a ride, at least that's what I pay because that seems to be the best option on the 27 screens it takes to purchase a ticket. Really...shouldn't there be a single button for a single ride? (I know, now somebody is going to point out that said button does exist). That's OK, the 27 screens increase the fun and tension as the train approaches. \n\nFor going out in Tempe and Phoenix this is the way to go, even without the 24\"" rims. But, let's not forget to ask...why are half of the stops in places nobody wants to go? why didn't the track extend directly to the airport? why is Scottsdale so opposed to having an effective system of public transport reach their rhinestone city? \n\nAdd 2-3 extensions and this train can really get rolling...of course that probably means higher taxes, so I will wait for the deep freeze down below instead. \n\nUltimately, it's clear that I need this transport device at my beck and call, so, I guess it's time to move. But if I get mugged or hit by a car or an angry hipster (or a silent train) on my morning run in CenPho...they better name that black train after me.",0
1426,0,"As a kid, staying here was always nice cause the hotel looked like a castle! Not to mention the huge arcade downstairs!\n\nThe last time I stayed here was in 2005 with my mom and her friend for her birthday. And I told myself I'd never stay here again! I enjoy staying at hotels, and after experiencing much better places to stay, this place is horrible.\n\nFirst of all, the towel's had black marks on them. Even after calling room service to have them replaced, the new ones has black marks on it too! When I got in bed the first night, there was blonde hair all over my pillow and sheets. I didnt have blonde hair at the time! It was such a horrible and disgusting experience!\n\nI do like the shops they have upstairs and I do like that they have a Krispy Kreme!

We were there as part of a timeshare presentation thing and so we knew not to expect anything but good laughs. Our room was extremely out-dated but very spacious, overlooking the pool. The employees are just as old as the hotel but I have to say they were all super nice. The best part of the trip was that there was Midget Wrestling at the Riv convention center and it was the best entertainment I've seen in awhile. We had a blast! The Riv is what it is but it seriously needs to be the next one to be blown up.",4

They're simple, not greasy (for french fries) and unlike any other fry I've ever tasted.  They've got a really unique texture...I can't explain it.  I love mine with that horribly good slice of cheese on top of them.\n\nThe double double is just perfect as well.  I'm not a big fan of fast food hamburgers, but I could eat these burgers several times a week!  The special sauce is like a thousand island dressing (think Big Mac), but it's not as tangy as the typical thousand island topping.  The 2 patties are thin, but not too thin. \n\nEven though this location is super busy, the employees are always super nice and very patient with newbies.",3

Our original idea was to go to the ramen place near this restaurant, but that place was closed for the holidays so we came here instead.\n\nI don't know if this was just an every day thing or a holiday thing, but the server gave us tea in styrofoam cups. Odd. Very odd. What restaurant actually does that? Mm..\n\nThe lady server we had gotten didn't seem friendly. If anything, she seemed annoyed when she took our order. There was 10 of us so maybe that was overwhelming, but it just looked like we were troubling her by our order or something. \n\nThe styrofoam cups should have gave me a clue. Besides their plates and bowls, everything else we had gotten was plastic. I had ordered their hoi nam chicken rice with white breast meat and oh man, it was... super dry. The sauce they gave me for it didn't even help hide the dryness of it. Ugh. I washed down the rest of the chicken while promising myself that I will never get this again. The rice it came with was good, but it didn't save the chicken. \n\nAt least the bathroom was clean. \n\n1 star for being opened on thanksgiving when everything else was closed. \n1 star for not charging for tea.",0

I had the risotto which was not bad but way too much and I would rather asparagus or some other vegetable than that tasteless and teeny shrimp. My daughter had the margarita pizza which again is NOT a margarita pizza. That was not fresh mozzarella. I don't like (boxing) my food up even if I have extra. But this was definitely left at the table. I kind of had the idea when I started to walk into the restaurant. The outside patio is surrounded by big potted dead as a doornail pots outside. Now, I know no one is probably using the patio in the dead of summer but it is the face of the restaurant and it should be kept up. When I walked in I understood why. The whole place looks dated and not that clean. I'm sorry, I really wanted to like this place.",1

I felt like they are waiting for ppl to finish off what's on the revolver belt before they put more new ones out. No wonder the first time I came the rolls with sashimi on top were looking dry. The whole time I was there this time.. Like 30-40 mins.. No one touched them and they kept rolling around without additional rolls.

I find it very confusing that you are greeted by one server, then someone else brings you the beverages, then another person introduces themself as your main server & then when you need refills, doesn't know what you ordered since they didn't take your drink order & then someone else brings your food. I never leave hungry there; however, this time & ordered the half rack of ribs & received 5 ribs with hardly any meat on them.  The taste was great, but I expected a bit more meat.  Also, it's time to introduce a real kid menu. I counted at least 15 other tables with kids, yet their kid's hamburger & a beverage was $9.00.  That's just ridiculous!  The server was also extremely slow. I never have to ask for beverage refills but did this time.  Also, we knew when she dropped the check that we wouldn't see her again for ages, so we handed her the credit card immediately hoping she would get a clue that we wanted to leave. She wasn't too bright, as we waited another 10 minutes for her to come back.  I would rate this visit 1 star; however, this isn't the norm, so I give 3.",0

The sauce on the veg chilli relleno was ok but the filling was just mush.  Mine had a different sauce which was very odd but the kicker was the meat.  There is no way that was filet mignon, it was cubed chuck or similiar and tough.  My wife said the consistency reminded her of dog food and I hate to say it but I agree with her. We paid $26 for 1 small chilli relleno stuffed with tough meat and mushy vegetables. Service was ok until after we were done eating. Waiter asked if we were done and if we wanted dessert. I said no dessert and we are done. Took another 10 minutes to come back to table and asked if we wanted check. I said we are done just like before.

When I got it at the table, my meat was cold. I walked up and politely asked to have it reheated.  When I got it, it was burnt to a crisp. On top of that, the lady sarcastically asked me if the sandwich was *still* too cold, that I should bring it back again.  That really irked me. She didn't have to say anything.

With all the options around it is not easy to come up with a different breakfast menu. Its different than most places. BUT does it make it better?? My main complaints:\n\n1-OJ is NOOOT fresh or natural. WTF!!? You would expect a decent juice madeout of fresh oranges. Especially with the high ratings in Yelp. Nah. \n\n2-Burned coffee. Yes, burned. \n\n3-Slow service. I waited around 30min for a table and when seated, other 10-15min only for the first plates to be served. \n\n4-My fiance\u00e9 ordered the \""popeye crepe\"" or something like that. The sauce (hollandaise?) was awful. Very greasy, salty, creamy and disgusting.

1468,0,"e2 emeril's eatery- I soooo wanted this to be the meal of my life or at least the MOTY. It wasn't the meal of the week, but I'll be back and here's why...\n\nAesthetics- The dining room is colorful and fun, the bar is very well integrated into the restaurant and the tables are very well spaced. I love being able to look into the kitchen and the wine cellar. The staff wears plaid shirts and jeans and I think this is another case of a restaurant having high class menu items and $30+ entrees and foodie selections, yet needing to say \""We're Casual. See look at how our staff dresses! Yep, we're casual\"". I didn't wear jeans because I was excited about having a nice dinner date, yet the staff was wearing jeans so maybe they just didn't want to impress me. There is a noise that permeates the dining room that sounds like a factory- it might have been the hood fans in the kitchen. It wasn't overbearing, just there hanging out with me and my lovely date. \n\nMenus- The dinner menu got me really fired up! There were at least four appetizers I wanted to order and one appetizer special that had me salivating (steak carpaccio with arugula). \nThe beverage program is also is very exciting. While there are very few old world red wines on the list- with very flavorful food like this, old world reds might have been overpowered. The selections on the wine list are fun and they cover a lot of different styles (South African sweet Shiraz anyone or Kung Fu Girl Riesling?). The cocktail list was also really exciting and our server recommended the bourbon and maple syrup drink to go with the lamb ribs, awesome idea! It takes enthusiasm, creativity and execution for a server to be so engaged that he/ she will recommend a liquor drink or beer with an entr\u00e9e. They also have local beer, fun wines by the glass and a lively bar. \n\nExecution- Service was good. We had our bread and butter plates removed before entrees, food was served over the right shoulder at other tables and  I was offered a black napkin (instead of just switching my napkins out), but aside from those tiny details it was perfect service. The water service, silverware replacement and overall attention and knowledge was spot on.\nCeviche Avelar- delicious salmon ceviche, small portion. Very refreshing and light. $9\nRoasted Baby Octopus- chewy octopus, crunchy chickpeas, great smoky flavor $9\nLamb Ribs- I still haven't made up my mind if I liked this or not, so I'll just say the lamb wasn't overpowered by the tangy tomato based barbecue sauce. $12\nCitrus Tea Lacquered Five Day Duck- very moist, and slightly chewy duck meat with a very delicate anise flavor. The veggies and faro were delicious. $30\nHerb Roasted Ashley Farms Chicken- Delicious, delicious, delicious! With a very delicate herbaceous flavor, very tender meat and enough leftover for lunch today, this was the plate of the night $22\nThe key to this meal was the depth of flavors. Everything had complex flavors, but more importantly had layers of flavors that built up as you worked through the plate. For example, the anise/ licorice flavor in the meat of the duck lead directly into the natural, earthy, grain flavor of the farro. It made the dishes seem very thoughtful and interesting.\nNeedless to say we didn't have room for dessert. That is the number two reason to return. Number one? There were a lot of exciting items on the menu that I still want to try! I really want to taste the Bone Marrow appetizer, the \""Ham Cured\"" Pork Loin, The Confit of Pork Cheeks, the Hamachi Crudo...dammit, now I am hungry again!",3

1476,0,"Having a taco joint open up in Shadyside was just about the best thing that has happened since I came to Pittsburgh.  As soon as I saw a brief mention of this place on the talk pages of Yelp Pittsburgh, I monitored their progress towards opening by \""liking\"" their page on facebook. It finally opened while I was out of town, so I made it a point to try this place as soon as I got back.  Walking back from school yesterday (Monday), I walked up and realized that they're not open on Mondays.  So I tried again today.\n\nThe brightly painted walls of this place remind me of a traditional mexican restaurant.  When you first walk in, their gelato lies in a similar position where Mercurio's gelatos used to lie.  From the end of the table, I ordered two tacos to go - one al pastor and the other carnitas.  They offer a number of salsas, and it seems that you can pack your own, even though they initially ask whether you want any one in particular.\n\nWhile i waited, i sampled the mojito gelato (\""with real booze\""), one of their many interestingly flavors.  It was surprisingly light and tasty, although there were quite a few ice crystals in my sample because the lady scooped from the surface.  I'll most likely try a cup of this the next time I come back; it has just the right lightness that I like for a summer snack/dessert.\n\nMy order was fulfilled in a reasonable time (there was only one other party that had finished eating already).  I walked home as quickly as I could so that I could enjoy my tacos while they were still warm and so that the juices from the meat wouldn't soak through the corn tortilla.  My only thought on the walk back was, \""I hope they put two corn tortillas, unlike reyna foods...\""\n\nAnd there were two corn tortillas!  The tacos aren't fully decked out like the \""super tacos\"" of small mexican joints - as seen in the pictures, they provide the meat and some diced onions/cilantro. no lettuce, tomato, or any of that stuff. I asked for a bit of their medium house salsa, which came on the side. it was very mild for my taste (I could barely taste any spicyness), so I'll be trying their next level up next time I go.  The carnitas was slightly dryer than I expected, which eliminated the soggy corn tortilla problem.  The corn tortilla had cooled down, and I think it would have tasted better if left on the griddle slightly longer.  The pineapple on the al pastor taco definitely helped the taste a bit, but like the carnitas, they were just a tad underseasoned.   They put one salsa cup in my bag, which I ran out after 1.5 tacos, which meant that I barely had any salsa for my chips.  So if you get your order to go, make sure you have enough salsa! The chips that were also provided in a small bag was a nice accompaniment to my tacos. Thumbs up for not putting much salt on them. For two tacos my meal came out to be ~7.50, which is high/very high for the standard, but based on location (being in shadyside), I understand their pricing, and I don't have much to complain about.  I hope they'll have those spicy pickled veggies (Carrots, jalapenos, onions etc) soon! those will definitely be a great condiment for the tacos in addition to solely salsa.\n\nBased on my review, I may just be accustomed to slightly heavier tastes (more spicyness, more spices).  Go and try this place! This places deserves to stay around.",4

1480,0,"Ah,Cibo. I was really expecting to be won over by this place and would have been if it wasn't for the horrible service from our waiter, James. Drinks and appetizers were lovely, so we asked James for pizza recommendations. He recommended the di Notte and the Capriccosa. Initially, I was put off by the artichokes listed on the Capricossa, but after a quick consultation with my boyfriend, we decided it would be fine and followed those recommendations. Our pizzas arrived, the di Notte and Vegetariana. Wait, what?\n\nWe left the Vegetariana untouched and called James over to correct the mistake. He caused a big, loud and embarrassing scene, presenting as defensive and aggressive as he raised his voice and refused to correct the error. He insisted that we had ordered the Vegetariana because we didn't want the artichokes on the Capricossa. When we pointed out there were artichokes on the Vegetariana and that it wasnt our pizza, James said, \""Well, they're only on one quadrant of the pizza. You want me to pick them off for you?\""\n\nWhen there is a table of 12 to verify a story, and two costumers have a different version of the event than the server, I think it's time to admit the mistake and move on. I was shocked by his behavior and apparently so was some of the other staff as they came over to apologize for his rudeness. I have never been treated so poorly in a restaurant before, which is not something I had ever expected to say about Cibo.\n\nThe food and ambiance were wonderful, but if service is poor, it ruins the experience and makes me reluctant to spend money here again. Maybe I'd consider if we could get Melissa as our waitress, who remained sweet and attentive and made efforts from the cash bar to make us feel welcome again. Service is such a key element in a restaurant and our server was entirely blind to this fact--although I guess it didn't matter much to him since his gratuity was already added in.",0
1481,0,"THIS IS FOR HAPPY HOUR ONLY...\n\nMcCormick's is a sold chian seafood restaurant.  I've dined here for full dinner several times and the food is typically well prepared, if unimaginative.\n\nHappy Hour runs Monday through Friday until 6:30pm with drink and food specials in the bar and front section of the restaurant.  We arrived at 6pm on a Fridayy night, and it was standing room only in the bar, but we were able to grab one of the \""happy hour\"" tables in the main dining room.  There are about a dozen items on the HH food menu, including a $2.95 half pound cheeseburger.  Prices range from $1.95 to $4.95.\n\nWe ordered fish tacos ($1.95 for 2), ceviche ($1.95), cheeseburger sliders ($4.95 for 3), sweet potato fries ($3.95), Ahi tostadas ($4.95), and steamed mussles ($2.95).  The fish tacos were two dry corn tortillas with one piece of blackened fish in each.  There was cabbage and tomato on the plate which we put on top.  They weren't terrible.  The ceviche has a thick tomato base and tasted more like ketchup than anything.  Mussels were stringy and chewy.  They looked dried out despite being cooked in a white wine broth.  The sliders were GREAT.  Soft rolls, grilled onions, cooked medium.  The Ahi Tostadas were also great; three peices of seared Ahi on fried wonton wrappers topped with purple cabbage and a sesame dressing.  Sweet potato friens are sweet potato fries.  They were hot, crispy and plentiful.\n\nThere were no liquor specials listed on the happy hour menu, only beer and wine specials.  I had a $5 champagne cocktail and hubby ordered a $4.50 beer.\n\nNext time, I think we'll stick with the things they seemed to do well, which are also the more expensive offerings.

When I first arrived, I did what any normal person would do and checked my bags... especially after being told that my suite was on the opposite wing of the hotel.

1491,0,"This place has so much potential and they really deserve two stars based on my last few visits.  The problem with this place can be summed up best by two words.... GROWING PAINS.  When they first opened I would have given them a 4.5 star review really enjoying the amazing beers they brew and the great friendly crowd and staff.  We got tours of the back of the house and you can tell the owners had a great sense of pride in their place and craft which they should.  As they have gotten busier and busier, the brewery cannot keep up with demand and when I went last time they had two beers left and one was an untouchable sour that no matter how I tried to like, I just could not get over the funk.  When this place is not slammed and has a full arsenal of their brews do not hesitate to go.  You will love it if brew is your primary motivation.  It's probably worth a call before you make the trip to see what brew they have available.  Trust me, if they are loaded up you will really like this place.  \n\nThe food is pretty darn good too but on our last visit took over an hour to arrive. We had company and were boozin so it was not that bad but if we were in any other restaurant we would have been pretty hot.  Recalling our tour when they opened, their kitchen space is very limited and I remember wondered how they would push out food at all considering the space.  They have done a great job with what they have but on a crowed night expect to wait for it .  \n\nTheir lack of brews may cull the crowds a bit returning this place to its happy medium and allowing them to shine again.  Until then all we can do it not eat bagels hoping the place attached to it goes out of biz so they can expand  :P\n\nAnother option they should consider is supporting other local breweries until they can meet demand.  While I completely understand their beer is their identity and the pillar of the business, if you don't have any of your own, there is no foul in offering a Four Peaks 8th street ale for example.  No they may not represent you but offering customers something as opposed to nothing is not a bad decision.  You are also supporting the local brew scene and it can only benefit customers and profits.  A win for all.",0
1492,0,"Pros: The food is alright.\nCons: Poor customer service, slow, ran out of soup du jour and pesto sauce by 1pm.\n\nMy story: \nMy first time to Le Belle Terre, I decided on some baked goods to go and the soup du jour and quiche to eat there. When it was my turn to order I picked out my baked goods and I was about to order my meal, when a man walked up and started talking directly to the cashier that was taking my order. The man told the cashier he'd like to order the soup du jour. The cashier diverted his attention from me to the man (with out an \""excuse me\"" or the like), took the man's order, and charged the man. When the cashier reverted his attention back to me, (without even acknowledging what had just happened) I said I would like to order the soup. He said that he was sorry but the last of the soup had just been ordered. I asked him if it had been ordered by the man that had rudely interrupted my order and he answered \""I guess so\"".\n\nAppalled, I decided to go with the rustic sandwich and no quiche. As I awaited my order, the same cashier approached me and said they were all out of the pesto sauce that came on the rustic sandwich. The sauces available for substitute were mayo and dijon. Seeing as I dislike both, I took him up on his offer to substitute the sauce with spinach. My order was served sans spinach. \n\nSmall gripes: \nThey serve water in dainty little plastic cups, which is fine, but there is no place to self-serve water. With no wait service and potential busyness, the prospect of more water becomes more of a problem than anything.\n\nLastly, their entrance is a set of double doors. The left door is locked yet there is no mention of it anywhere. A \""Please use other door\"" would better serve customers trying to enter.",1
1493,0,"I asked my Phoenix friend to take me to the best Mexican restaurant in town, and this is where he took me on my visit. I am happy that he did. I returned again during my trip. This restaurant had everything I love -- excellent and inventive drinks, delicious fresh chips with homemade salsas (the verde sauce rules!) and among the best guac I've had, and creative dishes in small portions that pay homage to the traditional Mexican menu. My favorites were the Elote street corn, which I think I could eat every meal for the rest of my life, the chicken taco, and the salad with grilled chicken, apples, mint and peanut sauce. The sangria was the best white sangria I've had in any restaurant.\n\nOne caveat to this rave review: I did not care for the pork torta. I do not like to eat a lot of bread, and the sandwich was ridiculously huge and overwhelming. Beneath the cavernous bread was a small portion of pork. Perhaps it is my Tennessee sensibilities about pork or my Californian experience with carnitas, but the pork was lackluster, dry, and tasted like that pork you get in a sandwich in the school cafeteria with the pre-mixed sauce. The restaurant should make torta \""sliders\"" and add a generous portion of real carnitas to improve this dish (see the Pastor at Taco Guild for an example).  \n\nOverall, though, it is hard to beat this experience, the friendliness of the staff, the excellent food and all of the options that left me wanting more.",4

There are some booths in the middle of the restaurant but the tables around the edges of the rooms aren't big enough for the plates.\nWe had:\n\nCaesar salad: Made table side with the dressing made from scratch.  it was ok and a portion big enough for 2 as an appetizer - very garlicky though\nFois gras something something: meh... served with caramelized apples.  the presentation was pretty but the taste was so so and definitely didn't justify the price tag.  \n\nPetit filet: good but not that hot when it arrived\nRib eye: decidedly average, a bit sinewy\nMashed potatoes: these were good \nCharred broccoli: good flavor but a bit chewy\nFlan: this was disappointing, it was really dense not light like I was expecting.\n\nBut the bread served before the appetizers was great! hahaha...\n\nThe service was just ok too, the wine waiter didn't seem to be able to recommend anything for my pallet and the best of the bunch was the guy that filled up our water glasses!  \n\nGenerally, this place seemed just a tad too happy with itself.  But I guess that's an easy trap to fall into in Vegas.  Next time I'll go back to Hugo's Cellar, it's worth the trip downtown.",0
1504,0,"Went to the P.U.B. for lunch and the food is great! It is a little expensive ($15 for a foot-long kobe hot dog), but so~o worth it. Even the presentation is cute. As people have mentioned, the service is hit-or-miss, but I did notice the manager hovering around making sure guests were being taken cared of. There is bar seating where you get little pails of peanuts - shells go on the floor vs. the little pail of warm popcorn the tables get. There is a large selection of beers and ciders - a few imported (ie. strongbow) and it is even possible to get a flight of samples. Next time I'm in town I'm definitely stopping here before my walk through City Center.",3
1505,0,"I went in with hopes that I would be blown away. Most of the crap I have done is at Del Web out in Sun City West. So I was excited that I would be having a procedure here and that I would be spoiled from everything I read and was told. \n\nMy medical records were lost, I tried to warn the nurse that my veins roll and aren't happy with needles, she didn't care - until it happened to her. Then she wanted to hear all about what I had to say about which arm works better and why. A random nurse walked around telling everyone she was lost and didn't know where she was. Which again, 20 minutes before I am to go into Surgery was the LAST thing I wanted on my mind!! My medical record was eventually found - in recovery - however I was still I pre-op. they all laughed it off, I freaked out! One of the doctors on my team made it a point to tell everyone she had never worked with my surgeon before and she had no idea who she was looking for. I could go on and on. Why am I writing all of this? Because as a patient I shouldn't have had to hear ANY of this. I was more stressed going in, hoping the right procedure was being done with the right doctors than anything leading up to my surgery. \n\nThe plus side. Private rooms, food delivered around the clock, and the volunteers that gave us a mini tour when I checked in. Otherwise, I'll stick to Del Web from here on out. \n\nAs for my doctors, I'll review them separate.",0

I asked the young waitress if she was sure the manager wouldn't honor the certificate and she reconfirmed he would not. \n\nWe would have ordered more food and perhaps even cocktails and they would have made more than the 5 bucks off AND made loyal customers.

1510,0,"This is a fun place and a cool place, but I'll have to visit it again to hopefully up the star rating in the future.  I have the misfortune of working out this direction and was pleasantly surprised to see South 21 Drive-in sticking out in a neighborhood of dilapidated buildings and BLAH-chain restaurants/stores.  I originally was worried that the place had closed down since it was never open when I drove by (after 10pm or on Sundays).  Some research online produced the food network visit and a menu and the date was set for my GF and I to drive out here for a visit.\n\nMy dire poverty makes this roughly the one time I ate at a restaurant in many months, so we went into this with pretty high expectations and an equivalent level of excitement.  We got there a little bit later than we had hoped and although the staff didn't rush us, I felt rushed because I knew they'd be closing soon.  We got a super-boy, a cheeseburger, onion rings, and two milk shakes.  I really made a huge splurge and spent about $16.  The burgers were ok, but nothing like I had imagined, they were pretty run of the mill and not nearly as good as I had hoped. I had been craving a non-chain, off the griddle, greasy burger and this one was slightly dry and without a whole lot of taste.  We didn't realize that to get the specialty with \""slaw\"" and other \""fixin's\""you need to ask for it \""Carolina Style.\""  The onion rings were OK, but not that fresh, so I'd like to try them again earlier in the evening.   The milkshakes were also just OK.  The people were nice and the owner seemed like a nice guy and he asked us how things went.  (my GF randomly ran into him on his day off and he was also pleasant... I like to buy food/things from good people so this is a plus in my book).  \n\nAll-in-all not bad, but not right on the mark.  I'd love to go back again though and do it right, especially if I could go on a nice summer day (are there any in Charlotte that aren't too hot though!?!).

I had the banana foster one today made with rum and cinnamon and the one with roasted pecans is an experience unto itself. Because they use fresh fruits the types of Paletas change based on what is in season, which is a nice touch and a good way to make sure there is always something new to check out. By the way, the little bit in the right hand corner is from the mold they use and indicates, I think, that they are home-made.Whatever they are, they are really good.\n\nBy the way, to get the plastic sheath off, tug upward a little bit on each side of the Paleta to separate it from the cover and then pull it off, then enjoy! :-)",4

1522,0,"I've been wanting to try this place for months, and finally made it the whole way over the Waterfront over the weekend.  I was not disappointed, thought in all honesty I was expecting more.\n\n\nSmoke's menu is meat-forward, and includes most of the items you'd expect to find in a BBQ joint...in a taco.  The meat is most & flavorful, and has most definitely been smoked.  \n\nI think my rub with this place is that they rely on the meat too much, and don't try to dress up the tacos much at all.  I feel like they should stick with the BBQ theme and dress the tacos as such, or go the \""gourmet\"" taco theme, and do some really good pairings with their toppings.  They do neither, and that fell a bit flat for me, considering there competition in Pittsburgh.  \n\nI tried pork, brisket, & vegetarian + chicken tacos.  The pork was far & away the best; it had that slight crunch that a good carnitas should have.  The brisket was good  but needed jazzed up a bit more, and the vegetarian/chicken was mostly beans & corn with some chicken on top.  \n\nIf the tacos were $3 each, I'd like this place a lot more.  For $4-$6, I think they're too expensive for what you get...layer the flavors like they do at Round Corner or Yo Ritas, or drop the price down to a range that makes them a good value for the money.  \n\nI will go back & try it again; we were there closer to closing time.  The owner is super friendly and I hope this place does really well, I just think they need to tweak their menu a bit more, as in theory I love the concept.",0

The bread service had pita chips and bread with an olive tapenade. It comes in ramekins that hold 1 tablespoon of tapenade, and given to share among 4 people. So, we were pretty much all able to have 1 slice of bread with tapenade on it. Wonderful!\n\nWe split an aragula salad which was actually very tasty. It had figs and some tasty cheese, but a tad too much dressing. That was the best part of my meal. My mother-in-law next to me ordered the penne (I think) and the pasta looked homemade. I suppose that's the one up-side of this place. Several of the pasta dishes looked like it was homemade pasta, but me, wanting to be healthy, opted for something low-carb. When it came to ordering, I opted for the salmon with a side of asparagus (4 stalks). My friend next to me ordered the same thing, and we were both incredibly disappointed. The salmon looks like it was butterflied in half so that we each got about 3 oz. of salmon that was incredibly thin. Mine was over-cooked to say the least, but hers was burned. The whole outside was black and charred... Unfortunately, the salmon which came highly praised by the waiter (whom I only saw one time when he took my order), was so small that I ended up starving and eating a bunch of bread just to fill up. So much for low carb. \n\nSince our party was so large, there was an automatic 20% gratuity attached onto it, which would be fine, if I ever got a refill on my water glass. I was so thirsty, I almost drank my friend's water. Sorry, but I will never be back. I think most of the people at my table shared this sentiment.

The place normally has 11 elevators so imagine the wait times. Each time we dared to go to the room it was a 20 minute wait each way. \n\nThe 4th problem I had was they did away with platinum members checking in VIP.  It's an inconvenience and slap in the face to people that spend thousands at this property to get a benefit taken away.\n\nI forgot the swimming pool is also closed due to remodel but they don't tell you till they get your money.,0
1542,0,"Even though I kinda miss the Sbarro's in the Overstreet Mall this place is a definite upgrade.  I think it replaced the bagel place, but I'm not too sure without doing some more research... the fact that I can't remember what was in place before probably says a lot.\n\nI only got a salad, but the places concept really intrigued me... personal pizza made right in front of you.  \n\nWent during the tail end of the lunch rush so there wasn't much of a line, but you could tell the workers were just \""bouncing\"" back from a busy busy period.  They were still friendly and I was surprised how much chicken I received in my Santa Fe Salad.  The house made, chipotle ranch dressing was pretty darn good - had the right amount of kick and they put it in containers so I had some control over how much dressing went on my salad.\n\nWill have to come back and try their pizza, but their salad is definitely a solid lunch option for me and I will be back!",2

1544,0,"Coming from Santa Cruz, I was sorely disappointed with Monterrey. I ordered the lunch special #4 (taco, chile relleno, beans, and rice) and there was nothing special about it. The bean were mush. I've had canned beans with more texture and better flavor. The rice was salty. The chile relleno was profoundly sub-par having very little chile to it. I also couldn't tell if it had been fried or not. The sauce that went with it was okay, but not close to the chile relleno at Las Palmas in Santa Cruz. The taco looked like it needed a lot of love. The meat was oddly seasoned and had gross, mushy texture to it. The taco shell itself was probably store bought. Ick.\n\nOverall, if I do go back I'm trying something else.",0

1546,0,"I usually don't enjoy giving places 1 star, but this has been the worst cupcake experience yet.\n\nMy sister and I went to try these cupcakes. She had a red velvet cupcake, and I had a carrot cake cupcake. Both were topped with a 'cream cheese' frosting. We both experienced a very alarming chemical aftertaste from the frosting. The cupcakes were kept cold, which left the texture and flavor of the cake rather dry.\n\nWe also picked up a few cupcakes for our parents, a banana cupcake with a 'peanut butter' frosting, and a coffee cupcake with a 'coffee frosting.' \n\nThe frosting screams vegetable shortening, both in texture, taste and mouthfeel. \n\nI would not recommend this place for cupcakes, there are better bakeries in town.",0

But showed nothing for the inconvenience. Paper work not being process like it should, they met with the very same people in July to get this same situation cleared. Still having a hard time checking into resorts when we go. So frustrating #timeshare",0
1548,0,"when this place first opened it was really good, back then I would have given it 5 stars. Now it is just ok. My dad likes to go there, that is why we went. \nWe started with the grilled artichoke. Usually this is pretty good. Not so much this time. Maybe artichokes are out of season?. It was hard and not very flavorful. The aioli that accompanied it was tasty. \nThe prime rib was ok, the portions get smaller each time I go. Very tender, good flavor. Nothing outstanding. We all had the same cut. Same side of baked potato. No dessert. \nProbably will go again as my dad loves this place.",1
1549,0,"Upon the chef's recommendation, a medium size sashimi plate was served.  However, it is unsatisfactory to my standard.  \nThe temperature of the sashimi was slightly warmer than it should be; I couldn't even breakdown the tendon part of the fish by chewing. (1/5)\n\nI didn't enjoy the dash of the kimchi sauce on one of the fish; it desensitized your taste bud to the fish.  \n\nWasabi was either those tube or the power mixed; I expected fresh wasabi with this price.  (2.5/5)\n\nThe miso soup ,which was water down too much for taste, was complimented with tofu cube and wakame (seaweed).  (2.5/5)\n\nAge tofu's (or fries tofu) sauce was too over-powering with sweetness; the flavor and aroma of fish flakes didn't arise to compliment the tofu.  (2/5)\n\nThe plate was chipped which should not been served for sanitation reason.  (-5/5)\n\nTemperature is the key to the sashimi and sushi not only for the reason of taste but sanitation as well. \n\nI may try hot dishes on the next visit to give a full judgement.   \n\nThe overall service was satisfactory. 4/5",0

I spent months traveling in India and know what the dishes are supposed to taste like and that there is supposed to be some actual flavor involved.

Do yourself a favor and check this place out.,4

Maybe the fact that I'm not a huge gelato kinda guy plays into this but this place was just a little over \""OK\"" in my opinion. The gelato wasn't bad by any means, but gelato is always just like softer, doughier ice cream to me. It'd probably be a better overall experience if I was into it.",0
1555,0,"Let me say upfront: I have stayed at this property for 5 years now while it was still Hilton branded. It was always ok if I needed to stay away from the strip and my Vegas trip was not exclusively for entertainment.\n\nI checked in there yesterday and the place is a complete dump now that Hilton dropped their franchise in January. Maybe it is because of this.\n\nThe service right now it is rock bottom, particulary of one of the front desk staff (Jennifer) that has been introduced to me as duty manager (who did not even have a business card). I reserved a room with a king bed and the front desk clerk offered a room with two double beds. Or another room right next to the elevator. Both rooms are in the central tower. The worst of them all.\n\nI used to get good treatment here as Hilton Diamond. Not even talking about the benefits that are zilch for me now after re-branding but I would say that as a repeat customer with over 10 stays you might get a slightly better welcome than this.\n\nI ended up just using the room as a storage and staying at the Renaissance nearby which is a very nice and modern hotel next to the convention center.\n\nIt has been nice here but time to move on. Avoid the LVH at all costs. You just don't know what you're going to get once you arrive.\n\nCheers\nS.",0
1556,0,"Believe it or not, I have never had a Philly cheese steak... until now. \n\nI really liked the decor. It reminded me of a modern diner/ regular bar. The staff were really friendly and clean! Since they cook everything right in front of you, I expected their shirts to be dirty. I was pleasantly surprised! \n\nIt was my first time eating a Philly cheese steak so it was hard for me to rate it. I didn't think they would give you such a long sandwich for only 6 dollars. I was full before I ate half the sub. The meat taste good but it was really dry. Are you suppose to put something else other than lettuce on a cheese steak sub? Overall, it was just okay.",2

He proceeded to complete a text message and then decided to look up and acknowledge me.  I asked if he was really sending a text when a customer was standing directly in front of him waiting to order.  He apologized and said it was his mother.

Brightly lit, and more tables and bar seats than booths. \n\nThe bartender wasn't exactly rude to me, but not particularly nice either.\n\nI snacked on some fries while I was there- pretty subpar. The beer selection was mediocre and definitely a pinch more pricey than the quality I got.\n\nOne great thing though, I have to mention, about this place is it is GLBT friendly and not flamboyant about it.

While I have managed well over the past couple of years to keep VH under control, I did have a hankering for Caribbean food this weekend and found A Taste of the Caribbean at Baseline & Mill. I could feel Vanilla Heat fighting to get out.\n\nFrom my table I could hear the sizzle from the chicken as it cooked and I began looking forward to its arrival. While waiting I looked at my mobile app and saw several Yelp reviews and the only negative thing I really saw was the level of spice. I am not sure if the owners made a change, but the jerk chicken was spicy on my visit. The chicken was fall-off-the-bone tender and had an excellent flavor. It came with a side of red beans & rice, cabbage, and 3 plantains. The owner told me if I needed more rice, cabbage, or plantains to ask him.\n\nThe restaurant is small and colorful with very pleasant decorations, and Pandora played nice reggae rhythms.

1569,0,"Here's the deal..... Had this been rated as a 3 or 4 star hotel, I would have easily given them more stars.  But when you classify yourself as a \""five star\"" resort, my expectations rise right along with your rating.\n\nThe good:\n* I booked on Priceline under \""name your price\"" for $105 and was accepted.  This was during Spring Break, so it was a great deal.\n* location is right across the street from the mall & Nordstrom.  If you like to shop, you will love the location.\n* NO CASINO, therefore quiet and relaxing.\n* Spectacular views from the higher floors.  We were in room 5616 & while it faced the \""old town\"" side of the Strip, it was nonetheless spectacular. \n* complimentary valet parking.  You may have to wait 5-10 min, but it's well worth the wait.\n* microwave, mini fridge, built in hot plate, & sink make it super easy to have a wide variety of snacks & drinks in the room.  Anyone with kids will surely understand this!!  :)\n* huge bathroom with shower & juccuzi tub.\n* complimentary shuttle to & from Caesars Palace & the Mirage (not sure if it's the Mirage or another hotel.....) every 15 min.  Very convenient feature.\n* Yoga @ 9:00 for $12.00\n* great gym\n* express elevators with three separate areas servicing certain floors\n* TV in the bathroom mirror\n* friendly & efficient front desk staff\n* complimentary water & Starbucks coffee in room daily.\n* extremely comfortable king sized bed.\n* If you are older and/or have any type of issue that makes walking great distances an issue, this is the hotel for you!  You pull your car up to the front doors & literally walk for 3-4 minutes to the elevators to your room.  Door to door in less than 10 minutes..... And maybe even less.  This is a huge plus and so much more peaceful than schlepping through a huge, loud, smoky casino.\n\n\nThe Bad:\n* the room was dusty\n* the pull out couch was miserably uncomfortable with springs popping through.  They need to be replaced.\n* the pool had trash in it.  Granted it was windy, but it was still gross.\n* $25.00 \""resort fee\"" that was never really discussed until I asked.\n* the desk was all stained & damaged\n* the window vent was broken & constantly made loud noise\n* the carpet was kind of nasty \n* I had to call down for bedding for the extra bedding for the couch & wait 20+ minutes to get it.  This should have been in the room.\n* freight train noise every morning..... Early morning...... All morning long.\n\nI honestly enjoyed my stay.  However, I would not rate this as a five-star experience at all.  This hotel is 3 1/2- 4 stars at best.",0

(Their lunch service runs from 11am - 2:30, so we were pretty much smack-dab in the middle of that).  I didn't expect the place to be hopping, but also didn't expect the place to be completely devoid of customers. I didn't take it as a good sign. The lack of any other customers made for a very somber dining experience.\n\nAfter perusing their large menu, I ordered the 'Rigatoni alla Vodka'. I make a kick-ass Penne Vodka, and wanted to compare notes on a similar dish. It was good, but not great. I will say that the pasta was cooked the way I like it, al dente, which was a plus. No mushy rigatoni here. The onions in the creamy red vodka sauce were red onions, which struck me as an odd choice. I love all onions, so I was fine with it, but still - weird. All in all, it was good, but I think I would try something else next time. \n\nThe other dishes ordered were a Chicken Alfredo special of the day, Pollo alla Piccata, and Gnocchi alla Sorrentina. They brought us two twee loaves of hot bread after we ordered, with (sub-par) olive oil and balsamic for dipping. Salads do not come with the entrees during lunch or dinner service.

It was strange. It was a pre-fab frozen desserts you've never heard of wonderland. No Tiramisu? No Panna Cotta? No Gelato? Very disappointing for a restaurant trying to do \""authentic Italian\"".  (Also the dessert menu was on cheapo, dirty white cardstock, with horribly dated looking photos, with \""Angela\"" on the top. Seeing as how the restaurant is called \""Angela's\"", officially, this also seemed like a big whoops).\n\nI wasn't COMPLETELY turned off, so T and I will probably go back to try the pizza and wine at some point.

The nachos were ok but nothing spectacular.\n\n Then my favorite part of the evening came next, they had Strawberry Lemonade on the menu,,,,,,,,,,Win! My wife loves Strawberry Lemonade and this Blue 32's version was definitely 5 stars. Every restaurant we go into she asks if they serve Strawberry Lemonade, the answer is usually no. Then she asks if they have Rasberry Lemonade and the answer is usually no. Then the server will respond that they have regular pink lemonade (the smart servers usually offer to have the bartender attempt to make the drink anyways). And she ends up having water. Needless to say, we saved a good 5 minutes in the ordering process.\n\nMy sons wolfed down the bacon cheeseburgers with the fries. They commented on how the fries were different and very tasty. Obviously the burgers were tasty as well. My wife enjoyed the grilled chicken sandwich with the honey mustard. \n\nI had the Monte Cristo Sandwich which comes with this outstanding rasberry jam and fries. But I swapped out my fries for onion rings for an extra buck. The sandwich is cut into quarters, although I wish it was cut into halves since the meat kinda slips out of the bread when cut into quarters. I enjoyed the Monte Cristo, it was ok but not outstanding. However, the rasberry jam saved the day and made the Monte Cristo very tasty, I even had to ask for some more jam. Their Onion Rings are some of the best I have ever had (they also have them on the happy hour menu). The bill came to $57.03 for 4 entrees, 4 drinks and an appetizer. Part of the equation in rating any restaurant for me is the value for the meal when combined with the taste of the food, service and ambiance. And definitely $15 per head including the tip (excluding the appetizer) is reasonable for dinner.",4

1592,0,"not that great. had some for myself this time around, and what you see is what you basically get. nothing out of the ordinary, so i dont get what the fuss is all about. i forgot what it was called specifically, but i ordered the polish dog. maybe it was because i felt like shit on the day my friends and i ate here, but the taste got pretty nasty after a few bites. most of us ended up not finishing our food. \n\non a brighter note, their strawberry daiquiry is DELICCCCCCIOUS! the best i'vee had in vegas, hands down. the only thing i would recommend is to freeze it up a little more, mine was kind of watery. taste wise tho, i would have one everyday if i could!",0
1593,0,"This was my 1st time here. It was very busy! I ate a savory, Dutch pancake for lunch, which was just ok. It didn't have much eggplant on it. It was mostly just squash.\n\nI liked the atmosphere / ambience and music, but the servers were not too friendly. No one asked me if Iwas enjoying my food. But overall, it's a hip spot.",2
1594,0,"Meh. I've experienced better for sure than Wet Republic.\n\nGranted, we did come early about 11am because the first # of girls get in free but damn, it wasn't poppin and even the music wasn't poppin.\n\nWe really couldn't do much except sit by the pool on their towels and put our feet in the water. No one was in the pool and we're all waiting for someone to get the party started.\n\nThe weather that day was bad since it was a predicted thunderstorm and the dayclub security told us to take our feet out of the water for 30 minutes because of the lightning that struck in the pool next door as well as being picky about moving our towels to make space for a walkway :(\n\nIt was getting irritating how strict it was here and there wasn't even a crazy party going on.\n\nI wouldn't come here again, unless it was 2pm and we had a speedy entrance.

1596,0,Went here for dinner last night. 3 courses and a glass of wine (making use of the \u00a310 set menu) strikes me as good value for money. The service from boath the greeter and waitress was pleasant and attentive and my sardine starter and hake main course w/ side of spinach were both very well cooked and presented.\n\n\n I'd like to give them a further half star but as ever having to dock a full one instead. The cheese board was the one minorly negative aspect of the meal. It could have done with a couple more oatcakes and maybe more onion marmalde and the slice of brie had clearly been allowed to dry out and harden a bit + the cheese knife had seen better days (the plastic handle was cracked clean through on both sides near the base of the blade).\n\n\n No idea if the interior's changed much since it was a Harry Ramsden's but it's well decorated and gets a lot of sun. I intend to go back.,2
1597,0,"I REALLY enjoyed our meal here. Thanks to my fellow yelpers, I found a place that is comparable to what I'm use to in the 626. Would totally come here often if I was a local.\n\nThis place is Authentic cantonese, chiu chow! Their hong kong milk tea reminded me of what I had in Hong Kong--perfectly brewed. The spicy clams, although it wasn't spicy enough for me, was so fresh and delicious. The Steamed Egg Mapo is ingenious--great substitue for tofu and I loved it so much more. And I totally agree that their sweet potato fries are a must try. We even ordered the mango crepe for desert and it was an awesome blend of creaminess and sweetness. Definitely going to make this a must stop during every Vegas visit. Will need to try their Chiu chow items next time (being that I'm chiu chow and all). Oh, and the service was great too--they kept on changing our plates and came over to make sure everything was okay!",4

1600,0,"Since Yelp orders things by original date, and there are 2982 reviews when I write this, I'm thinking my review will be read in say, March of 2017.  \n\nThat said, I've made a point to try most of the Strip buffets, the other reviewers aren't lying it's pretty tasty here overall.\n\nThey've got the small pots/baskets for a lot of the dishes like some of the other buffets do, and though they are cute, you end up with one on your plate, and no room for any of the other tasty treats.   \n\nAll the usual seafood choices (crab legs, etc...)\n\nThe bone marrow is good, but wow it's filling and greasy.  Do not have it first!  \n\nDessert choice is great, a lot of choices (macarons even!) to be had.\n\nService is normal for buffets, the servers are attentive and friendly, clearing your multiple plates away without you noticing.\n\nOut of the way to get to in the hotel though, which is both a good and bad thing.  Good in that it reduces lines.  Bad in that you have a long hike to get there, and honestly, it feels like you're walking through dead parts of a convention hotel where you probably shouldn't even be.

1601,0,I went to this place while traveling in the Quebec area and had EXTREMELY rude service. I arrived here at 11 sharp which I thought was when they opened. The door was open and I was able to see the workers in the kitchen. I did not go inside but was standing on the doorstep. A young woman who looked like the owner said something to me but I wasn't able to hear because the restaurant was right next to a busy street. I asked the woman again and she answered that they open at 11 30 very rudely with an angry expression. Of course I did not go back to the place again. They might have good food but the most important thing should be respecting customers.,0

1603,0,"I really like this gym really solid. Good machines, pretty clean (although it's declined recently). The reason they didn't get a five star is because I fell off a treadmill, no biggie I have a knee and ankle injury and sometimes it just buckles. I understand they have to do paperwork for it, but the two ladies at the front asked me really loudly in the middle of the elliptical section 30 minutes after I fell if I needed 911. I told them I was fine and if I can do it later. I mean they waited a half hour. Another 10 minutes would not have mattered. They made me feel like I did something wrong and have to go to the principal's office. No one noticed that I fell until they basically were screaming it out in the middle of the gym. They said they couldn't do the report at that time because they were busy, but considering what happened I think they could've stopped what they were doing if they thought it was urgent. It kind of added insult on to injury, no I take that back it literally did.",0

1606,0,"Chen's is 'aight.\n\nIf you're looking for basic Americanized Chinese food this far south of the Valley, then Chen's won't steer you wrong.  The lunch specials are the way to go at roughly $5 bucks a pop.\n\nThey give you soup but no choice, just egg drop.  They also give you a salad which I'm not very fond of.  The ranch they use tastes funny to me, maybe like it needs less mayonnaise and more spices.  Everyone seems to enjoy the salad though, so it could just be me.\n\nI'll usually have Sesame Chicken or Orange Chicken or General Chicken.  Basic stuff as the menu doesn't offer much beyond this fare.  Another thing I've found peculiar is that they seem to use the same vegetables in most every dish.  It's almost like they just switch up the sauces and meats. \n\nBut all in all, I keep coming back here because of the proximity to my workplace and the limited options of other Asian places around.  Between Chen's and Asian Grill in Sun Lakes, I'd go with Asian Grill.  But Asian Grill is like a hideout for me and all of my other co-workers crowd Chen's up on a daily basis.\n\nIt's still pretty decent, though.",2

Very satisfied for coming here and will definitely be back.",3
1609,0,"\""Meh\"" is exactly right for this place. After reading all the 4-5 star reviews on opening night, I was really excited to finally have a sushi place downtown. Needless to say, I was very underwhelmed by the whole experience. \n\nMiso soup was sub-par at best. You'll get much better Miso at Hana (7th Ave & Missouri) or Yasu (near PV mall). Miso is my favorite part of the whole sushi experience, and they did just about everything wrong with it. \n\nPrices were what you would expect for good sushi, but definitely over-priced for the quality that was served here. \n\nGood sushi is about fresh fish, so my husband and I like to ask the chef's for their recommendation for the night. The chef here sent us out toro (it's the fatty part of the tuna, good toro is like biting through butter) which also happened to be the most expensive fish they had. I couldn't even chew through this toro, if this was the freshest fish they had then I am seriously concerned about the quality of their fish. It was like chewing a tough piece of steak and very unpleasant. \n\nThe chef came out to ask us if we liked the toro, and when we told him it wasn't good he got very offended and insulted us (basically said that it was because we couldn't tell good fish from bad fish). \n\nWait staff was also slow (we were the only people there) and didn't know anything about their menu or sushi. Chairs were uncomfortable (they were wire frames, kinda like shopping carts). Tables were too small (every plate and glass on our table was literally touching everything else b/c there was no room). \n\nI could go on and on with the things they did wrong...but I think you get the idea.",0

Wait staff, as expected, was a bit slow and confuses, but if you look at the ENORMOUS menu that is excusable.  They did OK.\n\nThe food was just fine.

I had a bunch of work to catch up on so searched for a vegetarian friendly place that would also deliver. I was excited to find veggie Nepalese food that was close to the hotel. Every dish, even things that seemed like sides seemed pretty expensive so I assumed the portions would be enormous. I don't want enormous portions but I also didn't want teeny portions with a high price tag. I ordered a soup and it was basically a cup of soup for over $10. I didn't order anything else sadly and am left feeling pretty hungry. Wahh. Haha. \n\nShould have read more of the reviews!!!",0

1615,0,"Cirque d Soleil does no wrong in my book. Every show I have seen has totally blown me away. LOVE was AMAZING. I love the Beatles and combined with Cirque was 100% pure amazing in my book. \n\nI really enjoyed how they captured each Beatles song with dancing, lights and acrobatics. We sat in the 300's and had a great view on everything. The best part of all of the Cirque shows is that no matter where you sit you are insured a great view. The set design and sound is amazing. We got a steal of a deal on Travelzoo.com. Tickets were sort of pricey before the discount, but I would have paid for them even if I wouldn't have had the discounted tickets. \n\nI don't want to give away any spoilers but just be prepared to amaze all of your senses.

I believe the owner was taking care of us and she was super friendly and had great suggestions for a Thai novice such as myself.  \n\nWine was half-priced on Thursdays and we took full advantage of this :) We stayed for hours, drinking and munching on the appetizers we split.  This is a small restaurant and it was packed.  There are apparently a lot of people in Summerlin who love this place and for good reason: It was delicious.  Beautiful lighting too.  Don't let the strip mall location fool you.  Great for a date spot or happy hour with the girls.",4

He said he wanted to make a good first impression. He had a freakin broken finger! What an amazing dude. Really, he did not have to do that but I appreciate that he did. Also, I have a son, he's 2 and very restless right now so their waiting area is perfect! Cause I got to sit in their comfy couch eating yummy snacks while my son plays in their kiddy area.

1619,0,"I got take-out from Sal's for the first time yesterday, and I had a more overall positive experience than other reviewers.  I think that's partly because I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich, which costs about half of what the other sandwiches cost.  The young woman working the register was super friendly, the food was cooked quickly, and I liked the giant slab of pickle that's included on the side.\n\nThere aren't tons of options on the menu for people like me who don't eat beef or pork, so I probably won't venture very far afield in their menu.  For what it was, my grilled cheese and fries were perfectly fine, and I'll get take-out there again, I expect.",3

The suite we had was also a joke, the refrigerator was so small that it couldn't hold a 12 pack of beer that we have brought. The sink was really small too. Everything in the room seemed dirty and stained. The worst part came when I was actually going to sleep. As i pull back the covers, I saw about  3 different kind of bugs scatter among the sheets. I complained, and got transferred into another room, which also had the same bug problem. At this point I went to the front desk and demanded a refund, but they told me that I had to contact Groupon for the refund. I didnt sleep at all that night, as I spent the night in the car with temperatures of 95 degrees. I'have never had such a bad experience, their customer service was so horrible. As I explained to the manager about the bug problem he never once apologized, he smiled and nodded as if he knew already. It was just disgusting and horrible. NEVER AGAIN!!",0

1633,0,"**4.5 stars**\n\nI visited Jean Philippe in the Aria hotel for the crepe and desert.  I am sure I would appreciate all the food and dessert here IF i didn't stuff my face prior to visiting this place.  I ordered the Ham Crepe and it was a my first time eating a crepe.  It was a positive experience, but it's something I could do without.  Glad I gave it a shot though.  Maybe I am not a Crepe type of guy.  I'll try a dessert crepe next time.  You can see how the crepes are made in front of you.  It is quite a delicate process.  I also tried the white chocolate cheesecake and that was amazingly good.  The cheesecake has a smooth texture to it and will melt in your mouth.  Eyes will roll all the way back when people eat this.  It was covered with a thin sheet of white chocolate.  Presentation is superb.  I would go back just for the desserts.  \n\nThe restaurant is set up in two sections.  One area is serves gelato and crepes, the other half serves desserts, sandwiches, and coffee / beverages.  The location has a very modern look / design to it and is very appealing.  The glass case showcases all the desserts they have to offer and it just makes you want to order 1 of everything.  I was very tempted to do it too.  I swear every dessert were chanting my name.  The prices are bit higher than what I normally would pay, but hey its Vegas, you win big and spend big.  To give you an idea of the prices, a large cup of soda is $4 (~ 32 OZ).  \n\nCheck this place out for great desserts.  Do not go if you are on a diet because just looking at the desserts will be considered cheating!  This sin is perfect for city.\n\nBon Apettit!",3

My experience was pretty much the same. \n\nAlthough my massage wasn't completely terrible, I wish I had gone elsewhere. Yes, the massaeuse was older and it seemed difficult for her to perform a deep tissue massage. Her hands and arms were shaking from applying pressure. She was chewing gum audibly. The music selection was not relaxing by any means. Was that christian rock? Not too mention it wasn't a full hour long. \n\nWhen I walked in, the receptionist had a mouth full of food. She was awkward. The entire office was pretty crappy. There was a make-shift dog play area. When I declined to purchase another massage afterwards, she seemed genuinely disappointed in my answer.

In fact, if you've ever been to Bonfire in Monroe while its a lot bigger - the food here at Finz is head and shoulders above them, and I know my food at every level :)  Bonfire I'd pass on sorry. \n\nBathrooms are very clean, the bar itself and tables are as well, and the Waitress we had was a sweetheart! Loved her, very attentive. The prices were perfect! Nothing broke the bank, which is why we were able to get a bunch of appetizers and sample a nice variety of picky foods! Great menu!\n\nSaw kids leaving around 9pm with parents so there are high tables to eat at. I know you can book parties there, they apparently have two tonight per the waitress. I'd absolutely consider it for a party esp. with bands like Smiling Dogs or SugarSmax. \n\nAll in All, if you want a nice night out with friends, able to see and hear a band from anywhere in the bar (by the way they were not so loud that you left with a headache like Skinnyz).

Their \""fancy\"" margaritas are very good.  I got the enchiladas which were very very good.

1645,0,"I really liked it here.  Nice atmosphere, friendly waiters, cute decor, The Clash playing on the loud speakers (a wee bit too loud for my liking), and best of all - prompt chips and salsa delivery (for those of us who are famished and just don't like to wait).  Indoor and outdoor seating - with the choice of 2 patios.\n\nChips were good - not burnt or too thick, house salsa was nice with a little smokey flavor and not too spicy for those who are spice-challenged.  I ordered a cucumber mint agua fresca which was really light and refreshing.  Also got the nachos with a little added corn.  The server was right when he told me, \""it's like a meal.\""  Totally filled me up and I definitely had a lot left over.  \n\nWill definitely be back to try different agua fresca flavors and their veggie tacos!",4

1652,0,"Went here on a Thursday night at the last minute. We don't get to go out much so wanted to try someplace special. We were blown away by Barrington's and can't wait to go again. \n\nFor our first course, I had the mediterranean salad and my wife had the poached pear on argula. Both were simply incredible for many reasons. First, for the creativity and composition of the ingredients such as falafel, hummus, tzaziki, etc. Second, for the quality, freshness and taste, Third, for the presentation and display. \n\nOur entrees raised the bar even higher. I had the grilled swordfish which came on a bed of capellini. My wife had the pork tenderloin on a sweet potato mash with asparagus. The flavors of both dishes had subtle spices as the hint of chipotle in the pork bbq sauce.\n\nFor dessert, we split a granny smith apple cobbler topped by a scoop of their homemade vanilla ice cream. It was not too sweet or tart and was the perfect ending to the meal.",4

1657,0,"I stayed at the MGM Grand from September 27 - October 2 with my husband. My husband was in town for a conference which was being held at the MGM Conference Center, so that is why we stayed here. We stayed in a standard room with two queen beds (we had friends who came up for a night) that was more than adequately sized. The bathroom is pretty average for a hotel - I must prefer the bathrooms at Aria and Palazzo.\n\nThe hotel is still a maze to get around and you will walk...a lot! The trek from the room elevators to the conference center is long; the walk from the elevators to the pool is long; and the walk to the sports book (especially if you are going from the pool) is long. But it's a good chance to work off all the food and booze! \n\nThe MGM pool complex remains one of my favorite pool areas in Vegas, even if cocktail service is sporadic and slow. At the end of September at 10:30 am it was not hard for me to snag a chair mere steps from the pool. We did not dine at any of the MGM restaurants, but we did have drinks more than once at Whiskey Down (I had several very friendly waitresses there), watched Sunday football at Centrifuge (buckets of beer for $25 and much more comfy than the sports book), and watched several sporting events at the sports book (again I had several nice waitresses there). Taxi lines were non-existent so you walked out the door and into a cab. Plus getting to and from the airport is super easy and around $10-13 depending on traffic. \n\nAs a tip, if you are heading out to walk the Strip or just want to buy cheap beer without paying $8+ for it or gambling, walk to the sports book, make a right, and go out the doors in that area. There is a convenience store when you walk out where you can get $3.50 24 oz cans of beer to take with you while walking. Also it's a good shortcut to get directly onto the Strip.",0
1658,0,"Yummy, yummy, yummy!  My family and I have been eating at Carolina's for about 12 years now.  It is truly delicious mexican food.  They have the best beans, tortillas and enchilada sauce in town!  I cannot get enough of their food.  My favorite meal is a bean & cheese burrito enchilda style with a butter tortilla on the side.  Try it, I promise you will thank me.  \n\nThis place is streaming with professional business people, police officers, firemen, construction workers and everyone in between.  The line is sometimes out the door on weekday lunch hour.  It is actually better to pre-call your order in, although the pick-up line can also pretty long at the lunch hour.  \n\nThe only reason I am giving the restaurant 4 stars is due to the location and building's interior/exterior.  It is in a pretty poor neighborhood in a crumbling building.  But hey...maybe that add's to the authentic appeal?  Another Carolina's recently opened up on Cactus & Cave Creek, same food but much nicer location.  \n\nAs an addendum to this review the food is definitely 5 stars - it is that good!  Try it!",4

1662,0,"I reserved 3 nights at the hotel for a Monday through Thursday getaway.\nI bought vouchers through TravelZoo giving me a 240$ suite at 100$ a night!\nThe vouchers, I thought, had a massage included in them and 20$ daily credits intended for drinks at the pool.\nWhen I arrived, the check-in process was pretty fast except for the fact that I had to make sure I check-in every day of my stay because I bought 3 different vouchers (not that there was another option available anyhow). We were 3 people. We entered the suite and it was just as we saw on the virtual tour we took before reserving. Satisfactory. There was a large bed, a two-piece sofa, 2 flat screen TV's (which were never turned-on), 2 stereo system for iOS devices (I had an Android device :/ ) and a huge glass-covered bathroom with a stand-up shower and a bathtub.\nThe reason for giving the hotel 3 stars is not necessarily because of bad experiences, it's because of the timing of the reservation.\nI saw a lot of potential for the pool parties, which we were not in good timing for. The casino was not very young and the restaurant down at the lobby is not worth eating at.\nA positive is although the hotel is off the strip, there is a free shuttle leaving the hotel every hour towards the strip. The club in the hotel is supposedly good, but we never had a chance to party there.",0
1663,0,"This place was pretty nice (not super fancy but decorated nicely) but the food was average.  We came here bc someone had \""the best\"" beef noodle soup here over a year ago and loved it.  Unfortunately, they did not like it this time, stating it was somewhat flavorless.  Food here is definitely overpriced, as I learned many restaurants in the nice casinos are, but we were comped so I can't complain about price.  However, had I had to pay for this meal, I would not have been happy.  I got the Hainan Chicken Rice, which was really dry.  Usually, the rice is simmered in broth, but the rice was pretty dry - chicken, too.  We also got the Beef Chow fun, which wasn't bad but not excellent either.  The best part of my meal was the Iced Coffee (which I think they charge $6 for).  Everyone also liked the Fried Shrimp Balls, which came on a dim sum cart.  I was excited to see Soupy Dumplings on the cart, but alas, they were only moist and not very soupy at all.  Most items were mediocre and I most likely will not eating here again.",1

I can normally get in and complete my meal with plenty of time to spare before my lunch hour has expired.  \n\nAlthough I enjoy Mi Tierra for a midday bite, I can't honestly recommend them for dinner time.  I've been severely spoiled by the gourmet Mexican grub at Bonito Michoacan.  If I have the time to make the drive, then Bonito is my destination.",2

They were very helpful and friendly. \nNot to sure if I will return but my wife enjoyed it, so we'll see.",2
1667,0,This place is full of incompetent barbers.  I recently went to Joe's for a haircut.  The wait was long but stuck it out.  It was finally my turn to go and the staff bumbled the list and called another gentleman's name before me.  It was clearly on top of his but blatantly skipped.  How can I trust a guy with my hair if he can't read a simple list?,0
1668,0,This place is a valley institution. Bring cash. Don't feed the pigeons. Outdoor seating but misters help cool in the summer. Their fish is an acquired taste so I understand some of the negative reviews. My wife hates it so I eat here by myself. (She is not a local anyway).  I recommend the 4 piece fish and chips with an extra 2 oz special sauce. I have been eating here since I was a kid and hope to be eating here well into my retirement.,3
1669,0,"We came here for dinner the other night and we weren't overly impressed and, honestly, I'm quite surprised by some of the higher reviews. \n\nThe atmosphere was fine; low lighting, decently decorated, but it was much smaller than I had expected. It was also nearly empty when we first got there at 6pm.\n\nService was decent; a couple of the servers were hard to understand but we got by. Now, I understand the whole concept of how the servers will keep coming with the meat  until you turn over the little colorful toy looking thing but it was a bit distracting to have a conversation when the servers are circling around you and interrupting. Maybe it would be better to just bring out a dish of the samplings and if you want more then you could ask for it.\n\nThe salad bar was...okay. It wasn't anything to rave about. I tried a sampling of six different salads; mushrooms, tilapia and tomatoes, chicken salad, egg salad, crab salad, and garbanzo bean salad. Of the six I thought two of them were good; chicken salad and egg salad.\n\nAfter we finished with the salads they started bringing in the meats. Again, we thought they were okay. The beefs were definitely way better than the others. I liked the prime rib, the sirloin, and the fillet, however they were a bit over cooked for my taste but they were seasoned well and moist. Although, the sausage was dry, the ham was so-so, the pork chop was completely dried out, the lamb I didn't care for, and the piece of rib I got didn't really have any meat on it.\nThey also brought rice, beans, some other sauce, and a small dish of fried banana's. I didn't try the beans or whatever the sauce was but I did try the rice. It was plain, nothing exciting, plus it was slightly undercooked; I got a few crunchy pieces. The fried banana's were really good though.\n\nWe had the flan for dessert, it was actually really good. Keep in mind though, flan is pretty easy to make, but it was tasty.\n\nI think that it's a great concept and would be an enjoyable experience if the quality was better. While I'm glad we at least tried it, because it's always good to try something new, I doubt we'll ever be back. The price we paid wasn't worth it. Unless they lowered their price to $20 a person, I probably wouldn't come back. I think it would be a better idea to take your money to one of your favorite steakhouses.\n\nNow I was going to give this restaurant a 2, maybe 3, star rating however, after reading other reviews and seeing how the manager of Brazilian Bull responded to negative reviews I changed it to a 1 star rating. \nTip to the manager: if you want people to return after a bad experience, being rude, disrespectful and extremely defensive is not the way to do it. Being argumentative and trying to prove a point won't help your restaurant and you should keep in mind \""word of mouth\"" is a powerful tool. Learn some customer service and common courtesy.",0
1670,0,"This Wild Burger was located in the Wildfire Casino on S Rancho Dr in Las Vegas.  There were booths around the perimeter and tables in the middle.  There were 3 flatscreen tvs. We came for lunch and all the empty tables had dirty plates on them or still had crumbs on the tables and needed to be wiped down.\n\nWe waited in line almost 10 minutes for the cashier to take our order.  We all ordered the Classic Cheeseburger which  is a 1/2 lb Angus Beef patty withTillamook cheese using a $20 Groupon.  We were really looking forward to this burger which my friends have had before and rave about it.\n\nPink Lemonade came out of their water dispenser.  There was no utencil to pick up the sliced lemons.  The straws were way in the back and I had to move to coffee carafe to get to them.\n\nWhat we got was their Lunch Special-  a tiny 1/4 lb regular dry beef patty with regular cheese.  The fries were okay, but the onion strings were better.\n\nThe server brought out the Deep Fried Twinkies a minute after she brought out the burgers.  So they got cold and weren't very good.  They advertise this dessert as Twinkies.  We all know that Hostess went out of business.  They were actually Little Debbies.\n\nWe never saw the server again to ask for a fork.  My friends have more Groupons, but I won't be back.",0
1671,0,"I was looking to get out of the apartment on a really nice, sunny day and we decided to drive to Waterfront and walk around. All around great day until we hit Bar Louie for some drinks and appetizers.\n\nI am giving it one star, though it deserves none, because our waitress was nice, if a bit inattentive, and the hummus app we ordered was pretty damn good. Outside of that Bar Louie leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nThis is probably the first place I've been to where they charge $10 and up for all mixed drinks. To me, that is beyond ridiculous. Bar Louie is not an upscale restaurant, as much as they wish they were, and paying almost $60 for three drinks and two appetizers is insanity defined. \n\nAs I mentioned the waitress was friendly, but she definitely did not come back and check on us enough. I really wanted to like this place because of things I had heard and the drinks we had were really damn good, but if it want to spend that kind of money, I'll go somewhere that I can get good service.",0

On the side note, the fries here are great! ironic, everything I liked at this dinner was non-brazillian related. \n\nSome of our party opted for the all you can eat bbq but everyone wasn't feeling too great 30 minutes after our meal. \n\nThe highlight of the meal was their grand salad bar. Not only salads but had many sides. My favorite was actually the mini baby back ribs and corn cheese bread. I felt like I should of skipped the $40 steak and just opted for the all you can salad bar. \n\nTip: they have restauarant.com or if you have the Planet Hollywood Hotel Chain players card - they will give you 10% off your bill.",0
1675,0,"Being a (closet) fan of Jaimee Rose's  Azcentral blog, I had heard about Noca a few weeks ago. I always enjoy trying out new restaurants and admit to still being very unfamiliar with many of the well known establishments here in the Valley.Trusting her taste and the pictures and descriptions of the items, I was keen on going and what better a time than my birthday. We were a party of 5 and had the following:\nParents: Kampachi and a suggestion from the waiter not on the menu but very tasty (linguini with shrimp).\nGirlfriend: Pappardelle\nSister: Duck\nMyself: Spinach mezzaluna\n\nI have to commend our waiter. Very friendly but not overbearing. She was very familiar with the menu and was able to recommend some wines, which is usually something I don't do but felt comfortable doing with her. She was able to answer all our questions regarding some of the dishes we were unfamiliar with as well.\n\nPositives: \nVery class cozy ambiance. Restaurant was smaller and not exactly what I thought it would be with the \""bigger is better\"" mentality I'm used to in the US but that takes nothing away from it on the contrary.\n\nService is excellent for the most part. Never had to ask for water and the bussers and waiters always seem to have the right timing to refill your water or assist you. \n\nThe quality of the food was exceptional, though the 1 star penalty goes towards the portions or \""bang for your buck\"". I'd have wished for a few more mezzaluna's and other than my girlfriend's reasonable portion they did seem to be a bit too \""european\"" even for my taste.\n\nThe desserts really were the cherry on the cake. Perfect portions, very creative and tasty. You actually receive cotton candy at the end of your meal (regardless of a dessert or not I'm can't be sure). I really enjoyed the milk and cookies (excellent chocolate chip cookies provided with a cup of delicious vanilla milkshake). We also enjoyed the cheesecake dessert which consisted of rolled balls of cheesecake with a strawberry coulis and the small doughnuts with jelly were delicious as well. The best part was not footing the bill!\n\nNegatives (few but could use some improving):\n\nThe delay between our order and receiving our food was probably 10-15 minutes. I'm used to having some bread in restaurants that I would consider \""classy\"" or expensive and that was lacking here. They did provide an \""amuse bouche\"" that was original but for some could be considered a bit odd. It consisted of a spoon of mint,melon and pop rocks, quite the party in your mouth and refreshing but not very filling for the wait.\n\nI definitely look forward to returning and trying out some of their other dishes. The desserts were exceptional and I'm quite certain a few clients came in just for those, similar to what I do with out of town visitors at Oregano's. All in all a pleasant and welcome surprise to the dining scene here in the valley.",3
1676,0,"I love this place. The first time I came in here, I had never had a latte, except at crappy (Starbucks) or mediocre (Xtreme Bean) shops. When I took the first sip, I knew this was a whole different drink. A grin spread across my face as I got first a touch of light airy foam, then rich milk, and finally the smooth taste of the espresso. I thought I would get used to this, but I've been going there for nearly a year, at times almost every morning, and no matter what I get from there, it puts a grin on my face (except the agave latte, I can't believe people drink that). Even the non-coffee-snobby drinks like the vanilla latte, the chai or the mocha are brilliant. I don't go in as often as I used to now, because I buy their beans and make my coffee at home, mimicking their setup as best as I can.\n\nAs far as the service, yes it's true, there is some times a bit of attitude, but quite honestly, you're paying a little more to get a skilled person to make you a delicious drink of the caliber you can only get at a select few places in the valley. If you want a fake-smiling robot who doesn't know how to pull a shot, go to Starbucks. If you want a real human barista who will learn your name and your drink, and yes, maybe mock you a little bit for being a phillistine (and we all are sometimes), then Cartel is the place for you.\n\nThe only reason I only give it 4 stars is that they don't serve food. I think they said it's because they don't have a food license at this location or some such (and it might be kind of small for a cafe anyway), but it really would be nice to be able get something to eat here too.",4

1679,0,"If only I could give NO STARS!!!!I absolutely hate United! They lost my parents luggage on May 15th and to date they are still claiming that they are still trying to \""trace\"" the bags and they have no record of it ever leaving Las Vegas.

They claim they have a liability of up of $3300 but only if you can prove what was inside the suitcase with receipts. Even that is still iffy. The most they would ever do for a customer is provide a voucher. Who in their right mind would ever travel with them again after that.  Who the hell carries receipts of all their items! Honestly, I am sure the bag has been stolen and we will never see it again, but I am so disappointed in how United has handled a customer's belongings.

I want to start by saying that anyone reviewing an airport shuttle service must be pissed off at the level of service but there are some good solid reviews here. That being said, next time, I am taking a cab! \n\nThis chodu was wainting outside of the Venetian on his phone. When I asked how much to the airport he offered the price of $8. So far so good. I asked how long to the airport and he told me that he would be waiting until 25 minutes after the hour but had a pick up at Ceasars, after that 10 minutes until the airport. Still going strong... \n\nWe agreed and he grabbed our luggage. Thank God it's strong luggage because he wasn't careful. I was waiting for him to get up and body slam anything he thought may not be broken for good measure.

We picked up the other couple and were well on our way to the airport. \n\nWe got to terminal one and he waved at one couple who got off and we again parted. The other terminal was quite a distance I thought. What an airport! We pulled up and he says \""Virgin Airlines, this stop\"" so all but me and my wife got up to leave. My wife and I remained still waiting for our stop. He saw this and asked again what airlines we were on. When I told him he lost it! There is no better word, he simply lost it. He told me I lied to him and that we said Virgin Airlines and told us too bad, we had to get off the bus. When I tried to reason with him he said \""If you argue, I will call the police\"" realizing we now had 60 minutes, were at the wrong terminal and he held our baggage I saw the lost cause on inviting him to call. I told him that he didn't deliver us to our destination so he didn't deserve to get paid for his lack of service, courtesy and absolutely rude behaviour.

Short of taking a swing I gave him his money, grabbed our bags and started our journey of finding a way to the other terminal before we missed our flight! We made it but my recommendation is to get a cab. Unless you REALLY enjoy gambling, these shuttles are not worth the risk.",0

You can get your groceries (Whole Foods), household items (Target), shopping on (Apple, H and M, etc.), and dining all in one trip!  This is truly genius and something I wish I had in my neighborhood.  The weather was absolutely gorgeous when we went; making an outdoor stroll pleasant and enjoyable.  There is also a nice green space right in the center where families and chill and kids can relax. The architecture is modern with an Italian stucco flavor.  Great place to take the family on the weekend.",3
1694,0,"I was unimpressed with Caesar's Palace especially since Caesars Palace markets so much hype behind its name.  I was expecting more upscale hotel common areas, lounges and casino floors. We even had an updated room in the Palace tower, but it still didn't make up for the less than appealing casino and tacky common areas.  I was also expecting a customer service oriented hotel/casino staff that most people would expect from any hotel in the US.   We really enjoyed visiting and gambling at the Bellagio, Wynn/Encore, and Planet Hollywood (all of which had much cheaper rooms when I had booked CP).  The Bellagio and Wynn/Encore felt and looked (and smelled) 4-5 stars and that is what I had in mind when I booked Caesars. In my opinion, Caesars Palace is a 3 star hotel if you stay in the newer towers.  2 star for the Roman tower rooms.   The poor guest service, outdated 80s lack luster casino areas, and thick throat constricting stench of the place really brings Caesars Palace down. Sure the marble and statues are nice and some areas are nicer than others, but Caesars Palace as a whole is disappointing.  The place reeks of cigar smoke and an airfreshner that is a mix of kitty litter and sunless tanning spray.  The sports book is lacking in a huge way.  If the prices for Caesars were more around $169 or less than it would be a reasonable place to stay.\n\nWe paid $330 a night to stay at Caesars and for that price we could have booked the Bellagio and received true Vegas luxury throughout the hotel and casino.    Our room was not comped or discounted.   Our trip was pre-paid and set up through a travel agent.    We were there Nov.4- Nov.7, 2010.    \n\nCheck-In was horrible.  As seeing how they have over 3300 rooms, Caesars Palace should be experienced with how to check-in guests efficiently even during the busiest times...that is their job as a hotel.  There should be no excuse for how we were treated like second class citizens upon check-in.   I was very patient, polite and kind to the check-in staff during my dealings with them.   We waited over 7 hours to check-in.   I called to talk with a manager after our return home to let the hotel know about our check-in experience, and the supervisor I talked with could care less.  Apparently, having to wait hours for a room is par for the course during busy times and the hotel doesn't care.  The supervisor chalked it up to being busy and that they have to deal with travelers all of the time (Hello... what hotel doesn't have to deal with travelers??)  It seems like the hotel staff and bar staff and casino staff assumes that everyone is comped and getting a free room because they are the most uncaring and apathetic lot of staff I have ever dealt with at a hotel.   \n\nOur palace tower room was nice, but outdated some.  The casino was lame and slots were tight.  Cocktail waitresses were unattractive and rough on the edges.  This is not the hip place in Vegas to be.  The Forum Shops and Forum shops restaurants are nice. Dont be fooled by the marketing.  Caesars Palace is a rip off!  There are several other casino hotels on the strip that are much higher quality and updated, with better customer service, and the same price or  much cheaper than Caesars.",0

You will stand in line FOREVER while (I think) the bars are clearing out the liquor and such.. It becomes 18+ at this point which is SO WACK in my opinion. Plus my feet were killing me standing there for so long waiting for the place to open back up. The after-hours is not at all a club atmosphere.

The handful of times I have brought my 2010 Dodge Mega Cab Diesel in, I have received horrible customer service, 1st time I brought my truck in for the front bumper being loose and hanging down, I get JR Fisk as my service tech, I explain that I just bought the truck, it has 3k miles on it and the bumper is falling off. I ask that the bumper be realigned and tightened up. After a few hours I get the truck back and head home, only to find the bumper just shoved into the body and tightened. I return the truck and show them the bumper, the response I got was \""we are not a body shop\""........ That's nice......... So I brought my truck down to Chapman which wasn't much better with their attitude but did realign the bumper......... Moving forward to today, 6-2-12 I bring my truck in for a check engine light, 22k miles, oxygen sensor failure.  Jr Fisk comes up and, he says we don't have a diesel tech today...... Ok when will you? Monday - Friday, ok. Jr tells me to call 309-8000 to schedule an appointment.

I hang up and my wife calls back, gets put in hold for 20 more mins......... Wife finally gets pissed and drives back out to your dealership. Hopefully someone will help out this time, Why is it that your service employees have an attitude like they don't enjoy their job so it rubs off on the customer, I spent $55,000 on our truck and this is the service we receive????

It was around 10 dollars for their 'stuffed' french toast. Let me tell you what stuffed means to them. It means two slices of toast with some kind of cream cheese filling spread in them. And where does the raspberry come from? The five raspberries they throw on top of it. But I could look past this, I guess, as their way of making stuffed french toast. I surely don't expect something like Ihop, since this is suppose to be 'home cooked meals'. But when your stuffing is so miniscule it's like you spread a small amount of butter on toast, it is very disappointing.\nThen came the omelet with the hash browns. It wasn't great. Not bad.

1726,0,"After a fantastic visit to the NY location four or five years ago, I was excited to eat at Scarpetta again. Unfortunately our experience at the Vegas location was a huge disappointment. The food was still delicious, but it was completely eclipsed by the terrible service we received, and we left with a bad taste in our mouths despite that scrumptious pomodoro. Our surly server wore a perpetual scowl, avoided our eyes when we tried to flag him down, and seemed eager to flee the table as soon as he unceremoniously dumped our food down, without waiting to see if we needed anything else. You would think he didn't WANT us to order more cocktails or courses. Getting a basket of that delicious bread proved extremely difficult, let alone a second one. Worst of all, towards the end of our meal, three of us had finished our entrees, but two of us were still eating our shared pasta, when the servers started clearing plates, including said hard-won bread basket. They literally cleared every plate from a six-top except the one we were eating from. WHAT?! No. Unacceptable. Rule no. 1. Do not clear until everyone has finished eating! I cringed for the waiter but I was also very disappointed and shocked to experience this kind of service at a high end, expensive restaurant. Needless to say we felt rushed out and couldn't savor the last bites of our meal because everyone else at the now empty table was sitting there twiddling their thumbs.

1728,0,"I have wavered between 1 and 2 stars for this place.  The manager is very helpful and genuinely wants to see your pool clean.  I'll raise it a star for the solid manager.  \n\nI would give it 1 star if not for the good service.  I have owned my house and cleaned my pool for 3 years now.  It has its own share of issues, specially due to its age.  I just got a new pump put in and replaced the sand on my filter.  Everything is now in essentially brand new condition.  I have gone back and forth with them about every single issue I have had.  The last set of advice made my pool virtually unusable for a solid month this summer. \n\n I was told to dump a bunch of crap into my pool to raise its PH.  Two weeks later I put even more chemicals in there to lower the PH, right after it was raised!  I was told every single time I went in that my chlorine levels weren't registering.  I would add more shock, more tabs and whatever product they were selling me.  It seemed to work fairly well for the first year and a half or so, then I would have to drain my pool like clockwork.  I would spend hundreds in chemicals that did nothing.  Then those chemicals I spent hundreds on would require me to drain my pool every couple years!!\n\nMind you, these chemicals are not cheap.  In fact, Leslies prices are consistently 30 - 40% higher than the competition.  I purchased a vacuum head here for $40, only to find the same exact thing at Fry's next door for $25.  \n\nIn short, I was paying hundreds of dollars for chemicals that were causing more harm than good.  My CYA levels were so sky high that they don't even register on the test. \n\nI turned to the internet to find answers to my problems.  I found http://www.troublefreepool.com/ to be a great resource.  I switched to liquid chlorine and stopped using tabs and granular shock.  After a 80% drain of my pool I am back to square one and a recovering pool.  It is quite frustrating to spend hundreds, possibly thousands, on advice that just doesn't work.  I bought my own water testing kit (Taylor Technologies K-2006) and do all my own tests.  My pool chemistry is now in balance.  Something I never had when going to Leslies.  \n\nI'm over you, Leslies.",0

The burger was quite large and plenty of chili however the taste left something to be desired.

The plumber came out and repaired the problem but left our water shut off at the house valve, no big deal really, but when we called in to see why we had no water and the repair was completed (even though the plumber never notified us he was here), and wanted to see if the plumber was on his way back and the receptionist was extremely rude. She told us that the plumber had left the water off because that was how he found it. Mind you both my roommate and I are off today, have used the water today and neither of us knew where the valve was or we would have turned it back on. This is where super receptionist comes in and tells me \""what do you think my guy is a liar?\"" multiple time to which I finally responded \""yes, yes I do!\"" It was a very simple fix, once she told me where the valve was I flipped on the water and life went on, but beware, if their guy messes up at all you will get defense secretary of the year on the other end of the phone.",0

There are quite a few varieties and I had the coffee with rock (spelling). At first taste, I can't say that my taste buds were overwhelmed by the quality of the ingredients.

Not really my idea of a \""friendly neighborhood bakery\"". Anyway- I decided on a salad and just watched helplessly as the guy behind the clear partition slopped my salad together. I looked to find something that I could ask him to add that would make my salad special, but nothing really fit the bill. I really like customizing my food though, so I sprayed it with cholula(sp?) at the condiment/drink island.

Quick too.

I usually stick with a house coffee with soy milk, so I do ok price-wise. I even buy the whole beans to brew my own coffee at home. I like it that much.\n\nLux gets packed, but I've always been able to find a space and get access to an outlet for my power sucking laptop (not an apple, by the by). The music is good and mellow--think the Shins or the Stones.

1757,0,"I've been to Carne Vino several times now. I don't know why, well, yes, I do, it's for the bread sticks. They're to die for. If you want to have a drink and don't mind paying more than almost anywhere else on Earth, then by all means stop in and enjoy. I rationalize that it's just the price of having those crack-like bread sticks.\n\nThat's really where my love for this place ends though. Just a word about price. Here's an example of how insane the prices are. I went in for lunch last week (and bread sticks) and the house special was $40 for  two drinks and a tuna sandwich. If you just wanted the tuna sandwich it was $19, and I believe the burger was $20. I'll admit that I've had $120 burgers in Europe, so it's not the most expensive, but for what you get (I sat for 30 minutes in an empty bar and the bartender never returned to take my order) it's just not worth it.\n\nFirst time in, we all had steaks. The quality of the meat was definitely far behind other steakhouses like the Palm over at Caesar's, SW Steakhouse, Delmonico's, Del Frisco's and the others we've tried here. Overly fatty and tough. It's always possible that you just go on a bad night, so I never write a place off because of one so-so experience.\n\nSo, we went again and my wife and I had the carpaccio (it was okay, just nothing to write home about) and I don't even remember the entrees. I just remember that both of us kept marveling throughout the meal at the prices vs. the quality, particularly in light of what you get for lower prices at the other restaurants in Vegas, even in the same hotel (Palazzo has equal and better food at Woo (now closed), Cut (amazingly good) and Table 10 to name just a few.\n\nSave yourself some money and visit one of those other places where you'll get better food for less money, or for about the same money (at Cut) just better food and service.",0

If you're not into peppery crusts, then you might find the cow at this place not to your liking.  Anyway, the steak was great, the desserts were yummy, the side dishes were  average (as all sides seem to be in Vegas), the ambiance was not bad, and I can't remember what I had to drink during the meal.  As for the service, we had to wait a bit past our reserved time but the waitstaff performed in a prompt and satisfactory manner.  (That sounds kinda dirty, doesn't it?)

Shania is beautiful but she sounded like an awkward karaoke singer.  Her long locks of fake hair were annoying.  After the second time that she walked into the audience to do selfies and ignore all of the other people at the concert - we walked out and went home.  We didn't think this show was Caesar's Palace quality.  I have been to Celine and Rod Stewart and they desire 5 stars.  But, Shania could use some work with a vocal instructor.  The loud instrumentals and all of the backup singers helped to cover her lackluster voice.  You would be much better off buying her cd and listening to it at home than going to this concert.  This is the worst vocal performance I have seen in Vegas and I have been to all of the major shows.",0

From the post-modern retro American decor, with a slightly agricultural flavor, in this family-owned and family-friendly, gastronomic paradise to the scrummy nomnomnomalicious treats, Joe's Real BBQ has it all. This is undoubtedly one of my all-time favorite restaurants in the Valley. \n\nI invariably survey the whole menu every time I go and I end up going with the ribs, which are always juicy (read a couple of reviews in which the reviewer said that the ribs were dry; I dunno, I think you went on the one day of the year they are dry) and coated with a BBQ sauce that is to die for. I've never gone wrong with the potato salad, coleslaw, or corn, but I hear the BBQ pit beans are great too. I'm not a root beer fan, but my son swears it's awesome and he's usually pretty forthcoming about things that don't sit well with him, so I've got to believe the root beer doesn't suck too badly. The pulled pork and the chicken rawk the sawks, so check them out if you get a chance. \n\nAlso love the take-out window outside. If you don't feel like standing in line inside (and there's always a line around lunchtime and dinner), then get your quick fix with some take-out instead. \n\nAll of the menus can be found at Joe's Web site: http://www.joesrealbbq.com/menu.php\n\nThe prices are on a par with Famous Dave's, but I think the food is much better, so Joe's offers better value and a real down-to-Earth, all-American family atmosphere.",4

There's more served than that, but those items head the menu.  \n\nI'll add that the Sing High premises are extremely clean and the service is timely.  \n\nWe had a lunch special with soup, egg roll, sweet and sour pork, moo goo gai pan fried rice plus a serving of beef chow mein.  As the web page also states, most items are prepared fresh.  My hot and sour soup was different than some hot/sour soups I've tasted, a little thicker, SIng High's personal recipe.  More a small burrito than an egg or spring roll, the egg roll was delivered too steaming hot to eat immediately.  The pork was also freshly prepared, my thinking back, my count is 9 unusually large pieces.  The fried rice was white rice cooked well, fired with soy sauce and a bit of veggies.  The plate of noodles was large and flavors good.  \n\nWe took home half our lunch and had a very good dinner later.     \n\nIf you've got jury duty, business down town, or paying a visit to Copper Square, this is a reasonably price spot to consider for a Chinese-American meal.",2
1777,0,"Ill be the first to admit that Orange Table in Old Town Scottsdale is probably one of my favorite places for breakfast food.  If this place is such a standout, how come Ive haven't reviewed them until now? Well it comes down to a singular word that many of you simply may not like, slow. Blowing the whistle in the first paragraph might stop many of you from reading further, but let me just say that Orange Table definitely has its merits, the tasty food.\n\nLocated a few doors down from the famous martini spot AZ88, Orange Table is quietly situated in the corner of the Scottsdale Civic Mall. Parking can sometimes be an issue in Old Town fortunately there is a large free parking structure just behind the restaurant as well as an open lot. Outside there's a large open patio that's dog friendly where I couldn't help but notice that having a dog is a great way to meet new people, dogs here are a commonality amongst the diners so feel free to bring Sparky. Inside the orange walls help to create a casual yet funky industrial feel, that reminded me of a few places Ive tried in SoCal.\n\nCorned Beef Hash ($9) is one of those dishes that can be messed up pretty easily but the OT version was spot on. Thick pieces of sliced corned beef and potato topped with your choice of 2 eggs any way you like them, over easy for me please. I love hot egg yolk flowing over pretty much anything, but on top of corned beef hash its like the best breakfast gravy. Sopping up the golden deliciousness, I couldn't help but notice how tasty the toast was, of course coming from Breadcrafters in Phoenix, you know its good.\n\nFor an Orange Table spin on the traditional Red Flannel (a New England style hash made with corned beef and beets), try the fantastic White Flannel ($10). They take their delicious corned beef, white onions, mushrooms, garlic and potatoes then spoon on sour cream and pair with 2 eggs, your choice. Creamy, salty and earthy\n\nThere is one Orange Table menu item that for me trumps all others. This might sound kind of crazy but trust me on this one order the Jalape\u00f1o Pecan Pancakes ($10). Fluffy light pancakes with sliced jalape\u00f1os and pecans mixed in, one bite and you'll understand completely. The chile isn't spicy but the flavors are bold with a textural crunch from the pecans all finished with a lightly sweet pan syrup. When you order these you also get your choice of breakfast meat including bacon, ham or sausage. I love the taste of good sausage paired up with pancakes, so when the 2 thick meaty shafts arrived I couldn't wait to try one. As I bit down some of the meat juices sprayed into my mouth giving hints of sage and pepper, could have ate an entire plate.\n\nOn my last visit the speed of the service was much improved, but then it was also 9am on a Sunday morning. Once the rush hits you might be waiting quite a while for your food, though drinks come out pretty quick.\n\nIf you're in a hurry Orange Table might not be the place for you but if you don't mind a little waiting, the payoffs are almost worth the wait.",0

And customer service? These people don't try to kiss your ass, they know they have great pizza, you want it or not, and I am fine with that, I don't like ass kissers. The pizza is great, lots a cheese, lotsa toppings, great crust, decent delivery, and an offer you can't refuse on Tuesdays, 2 for 1. Two thumbs up for Boston Pizza.

1784,0,"This place just opened up about 2 months ago. It is located right near Retro Bakery and serves up an array of different food. Here you can get a Teriyaki Steak Bowl,Chicken Ceasar Salad Hoagie, Turkey South Western Egg Rolls, and A mini Lemon Bundt cake...yup, you see an array of stuff!!! It is a small place with a nice family running the place. There used to be a few tables in there but because they do not have a public bathroom the tables had to be removed so to -go orders are most likely it -unless you'd like to sit on a chair against the wall with no table.....\nI liked the spicy corn salad, house salad, chicken sandwiches in which my pattie can be dipped in whatever sauce I like (Teriyaki) and their lemon bundt cake is good but the cake could very well come from a box... I did not care for the chicken ceasar Hoagie as the bread was too tough (hard to chew) and the Tomato Bisque soup tasted like straight up marinara sauce.The rice in the bowls need to be less mushy as well...\nEven though items on the menu don't seem expensive it can build up fast as sandwiches don't come with a side or drink.\nThey are new so I'm sure all the little kinks will work it self out and just today the owner gave me a free bundt  cake for coming back...If you are in the area give them a try - they just added some new stuff like fried shrimp,pulled pork sandwiches and I'm told that if you ask you can get Chicken curry on Saturdays & Burgers are coming....",0

There were used utensils in the shower, someone's clothes were left behind, etc etc.  We called to complain (and the very few times I've had friends complain about a hotel, we immediately got our money back and a new room).

So we are now 2h20min into the afternoon before getting our beverages. Fine, maybe service improves? not really. each time we wanted our table cleaned or a fresh round of drinks, we had to wait 15-20 mins. This seems really extreme. The food was pretty good. They had some very good dishes and some interesting twists that were delicious, mac n cheese with linguica was awesome. The desserts were subpar. They have so much variety but I couldn't find one that was even average. I almost chipped my tooth on a cookie, it was that stale. Kind of hard to believe until you experience it first hand. \n\nEither way, for $40 I would have been much better off going to a really nice restaurant.

I was really craving some seafood and at the time I forgotten just how poor the first experience was....so.... a group of us met at the tiny overcrowded bar area.\n\nWe were allowed to bring our appetizers to the table and still pay the \""happy hour\"" prices... I though this was decent of them.\n\nI was craving scallops and asked more than once if scallops were in season, as I know there are certain times of the year when such items are \""in season\"" therefore providing a fresher delicacy.\n\nThe one thing I really enjoyed the last time was their bread... it was crusty and soft and absolutely delicious.  I was told the bread is the same as it always was....NOT!\n\nDont tell me what you think I want to hear!  The bread was NOTHING like it used to be....this time is was simply \""bread\""....nothing at all good or special about it.\n\nAfter many appetizers, we were served our salad...again, nothing special..very basic, except for mine... I guess I got the birthday surprise... a long hair attached to a piece of lettuce! DISGUSTING... \n\nI showed the waiter who was very professional about it and seemed almost embarassed.\n\nThe group of us tried several items.  I got the scallops...after being assured they are in season and very good... Why do I bother to ask, when I know they cant say something like \""oh no...dont go with the scallops, they are small and not really the time of year for them\"" and you'll regret it!\n\n\nThese small morsels were overcooked and rubbery and lacked any flavor!\n\nA couple people got surf and turf and the steak also lacked any flavor/seasoning and was not cooked to was was requested.\n\nThe lobster, I was told was o.k but nothing to rave about.\n\nWe experiemented with some shrimp toast which I really cant describe because I am not sure what it tasted like other than salty...couldnt not detect the shrimp taste.\n\n\nI returned my scallops and after the hair and rubbery food had no desire to try anything else.\n\nThe owner had come over to the table and apologized for the \""series of events\"", his excuse for the hair being that due to the ventilation system hair and partical will fly around... (which of course has to land somewhere...why not my salad) \n\nThey removed my scallops from the check....duhhhh any mediocore place would do the same.\n\nI would like to give a special THANK YOU to our waiter.. my apologies for not remembering your name, but he was terrific!  Friendly, quick and when we needed him...he was around.\n\nWe got out of there with what I feel is a HIGH price to pay for such a distasteful experience.\n\nWhen I got home and after hearing my friends give their critique of my choice of restaurant to celebrate at I was pretty unhappy!\n\nI felt the owner, although a nice man, did not care enough about his customers to do something a little \""above and beyond\"" to apologize for the experience and try to keep a customer.\n\nI called the restaurant and spoke with the owner and told him I was very dissapointed and felt that he should have done something more than make excuses.. he kept apologizing and I assured him none of the 5 of us would every return to Salt Cellar.\n\nHe finally said he would like to do something for me and asked for my address.\n\nHere it is a couple weeks later...not sure why he wanted my address...maybe he is gonna picket my house or send mean letters...who knows... he never did anything!\n\nIt is clear to see why his restaurant is not packed as it was years ago....You may have the repeat business from those who have been patronizing your establishment from back in the day when your food was actually good, or there were no other options for seafood...but guess what?  There are other options!\n\nAt this point in my review I usually suggest you go and try for yourself...but this time I am going to save you the time and money....GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!\n\nYou will be glad you did.\n\nAs for the owner of Salt Cellar....apologies and excuses are simply words....Stand behind your restaurant...you should have wanted to prove to me that you do a better job than was we experienced.\n\nYou are cutting too many corners to save money and it is costing you your customers!\n\nYour actions speak for themselves!\n\nIt used to be when you mention Salt Cellar people would ooohhh and ahhh...those days are gone, most of the people I mention it to have no idea what Salt Cellar is.\nThat speaks VOLUMES!\n\nAnd so I say...

When they finally showed up I let her know Ill just take them to go since Im out of time. She didn't seem to care at all I was clearly upset. Also NOT ONE TIME did she refill my drink...not one time. And to top of the whole fun experience I get the check to find out they have stopped the wings deal on Monday. \n\nIts sad cause I used to go here with all my friends every Monday and this place had good waitresses who cared but like I said earlier these people now don't care one bit.

1814,0,"As many previous Yelpers mentioned Hard Rock Hotel (HRH) didn't live up to my expectations either.\n\n- lopsided bed, $15 hidden resort fee, no free wifi, smokey in hallways (should separate nonsmoking area from smoking), Starbucks cost 2x as much, Mr. Lucky's restaurant promotions don't work on holidays even though they promoted it that way, dimly lit bathrooms, poor electrical wiring (light switches didn't always turn on lights and some turned off all), fan blew directly towards bed and not able to be changed direction, insulation not well because we could hear our loud neighbors, direction of check-in is terrible (didn't realize there were several towers with different check-ins and parking garages).\n\n+ TV wasn't blasting loudly when you first turn it on, comforters were extremely comfortable, rock and roll decoration and photos.\n\nTargeted towards a specific crowd, tattooed, 20s & 30s. Across the street, you can get really good German food! It's actually not that close to the Strip as you think it is. It's at least 2 miles. (I measured it when I drove). So it would be not recommended to walk, unless you don't mind the distance and have time to spare.\n\nI will not stay here again nor recommend it.",0
1816,0,"After a night out and skipping dinner, we were starved! We really wanted to try the Mexican restaurant in Aria but they were closing (boo!). After asking which restaurants are still opened we chose Lemongrass. \n\nThe decor is pretty and modern. The booths are hard to get into though! You cant just slide in. On the table they have a cup with wooden/bamboo chopsticks. I personally think if it was an upscale Asian restaurant they'd be pretty and reusable but that's my opinion. \n\nWe ordered Tom Kha Chicken to start which was awesome. They didn't spoon the soup into individual bowls which I thought was odd. I guess I'm just use to Asian restaurants doing that. For our main course we had black pepper prawns, sweet and sour chicken, some kind of curry, and I think Chow Fun. All tasted good but weren't outstanding. I guess I've had better Thai/ Chinese food with better service for cheaper back home. But then again I have to give them credit for being open so late. \n\nAfter adding some sodas, beers, and white rice the total was well over $100. Overall I doubt I will return even for late night grub.",0

OK fine, when the server brings me the noodle i notices its cold noodle! So, I ask the server again why its cold. first she thought its not right and should not be cold.  She went to ask the chef.  I can hear the chef yelling from the kitchen because the noodle is rinsed in cold water so we can stir in the za jiang sauce.  (even if its rinsed in cold water, it still should be at warm temperature. ) I told the server maybe the chef forgot about our noodle is being rinsed.  Maybe its being soaked in cold water too long.  after I heard the chef and food server is talking shit in Chinese in the restaurant. At this point, I don't want to eat there anymore.  It was their mistakes and they do not admit and blame to the customer.",0

1821,0,Tired of going to mass and not understanding the gospel? Well then this is the church for you! I honestly dislike going to church and being so lost during the gospel because the priest does not make it relatable. Father Nadim on the other hand uses real life experiences when speaking about the gospel. We also had a private mass for both my daughter's baptism and it was great! I was almost brought to tears due to the way Father Nadim explained things during the mass. He also knows how to make things funny which makes time go by fast!

The same night I arrived, my girlfriend and I decided to take a stroll in the Cosmopolitan hotel and went up to the third floor to search for the hallway my friend tipped me about.  Just as my friend mentioned, the smell of pizza overpowered my senses and everything looked delicious.  I decided to go with a slice of cheese and pepperoni while my girlfriend went with the white pizza with mushrooms.  Upon the first couple bites, the pizza was absolutely delicious.  The thing that really put me over was the crust.  The crust was perfectly crunchy and tasty.  I will have to say that this place takes my favorite small pizza spot back in Houston simply because of the crust.  Although it is a couple dollars more than the slices back home, I will consider this pretty cheap knowing that i would spend over $80 for my girlfriend and I had we ate in one of the restaurants next door.  For this, I will have to say this is the best pizza I have had, at least from a smaller/not-too-fancy pizzeria.  We went back to eat here the next night too! Go get you some!",4

1826,0,"We had bought tickets the moment they were available to the midnight showing of New Moon, so it was a few months before the premiere this past weekend. We expected it to be busy, and planned accordingly.\n\nLittle did we know that a new promotion had come out just a couple of weeks before the premiere, where you could upgrade your ticket to see \""Twilight\"" beforehand, then keep your seat for New Moon. This seemed extremely unfair to those of us who simply wanted to see New Moon, and not pay $5 more a ticket to sit through a movie we've seen before just to claim a seat. We soon heard buzzing from other people in line of their disgust, and after a complaint to the manager we were let in early without paying for the upgrade.\n\nIt didn't matter. We were in the third row, all the way on the side. The theatre was 95% full of people watching Twilight. It wouldn't have mattered if we had camped out 24 hours before the midnight showing, we still wouldn't have had a decent shot at a seat.  Very bad planning on the part of the theatre. This will guarantee that I never attempt a popular premiere at Harkins again. It was as if we were being punished for doing everything right, since we bought our tickets in plenty of time, and showed up hours before. You expect it to be busy, naturally. However everyone should have had an equal shot at getting a good seat. Bad move Harkins, bad move.",0

1830,0,I have been here way too many times but I am officially done giving them chances. So frustrating that this place doesn't step it up! It is pretty much an overpriced bar. They have a large selection of just mediocre bar food. I love the concept and it's tons of fun for kids. But I can't bring myself to go here again because I can't bare the food. They have no healthy options on their kids menu and it's not much better on the regular menu. I consider this place a kid-friendly restaurant due to the atmosphere and concept. But the service is way too slow! The number one thing that I look for when bringing kids out to eat is fast service. It's no secret that kids have no patience for waiting 15+ minutes for a check. And happy kids equal happy customers. Crying and winy kids equal annoyed and unhappy customers. So speed it up at least please!,0

Das ist schon mal die halbe Miete. Anders sah es beim Essen aus. Wir mussten 1,5 Std. auf das Essen warten, obwohl der Laden so gut wie leer war. Kurz vor dem Servieren ist der K\u00fcche aufgefallen, dass Zutaten f\u00fcr die eine Speise (ich wei\u00df nicht mehr was bestellt wurde) ausgegangen waren.

It is beautifully decorated, clean, and has a nice relaxing ambiance. \n\nOur server was polite, prompt and eager to please. She made several suggestions for us and we were checked on by her and other employees there. Our drinks were always full so they earned points there.\n\nWe ordered miso soup and four sushi rolls (spicy tuna, las vegas, dragon roll and the aloha roll). The miso soup was delicious. It was fresh and full of flavor. The sushi rolls were just ok. I was hoping to walk away with an overall great experience but I just could not get into the rolls.

1835,0,"Yo tasty, yo tasty, yo tasty yo!\n\nTasty Yo has frozen yogurt that is all good for you and stuff, but it's only one flavor, and it can have that funky fro yo aftertaste, which sucks.  On that note, Yoforia is better.\n\nBut for toppings, I have to give the nod to Tasty Yo, both because they have some suggestions on the board which means you don't have to figure out what to put on your \""yo\"" (uh, well, I trust you know what I mean, yo?), and because they do it for you, which means that you don't have to deal with someone else's nasty hands digging into the bowls.\n\nThe other thing that is cool is the serving size is perfectly reasonable.  You get a bowl that looks about like what you'll end up with - even a pretty little swirl on top (think DQ).  Then they give you up to three toppings.  That's nice.\n\nAt Yoforia, for example, you get these bowls that are so big that you can almost bathe in them.  Then when you fill it up with everything you can, they weigh the bowl and you pay by the ounce, which means you need to take out a mortgage to buy your yo.  Yo.  So again, Tasty Yo wins.\n\nThe only downside is that the place looks like a dorm room.  It is a decent dorm room, and they (apparently) have wifi.  If you do foursquare, you can check in for the first time and get a discount.  If you're the mayor, the deal is even better.  But it's still a dorm room, yo.",0

She asked if we wanted a to-go cup of coffee. No one has ever offered that!\n\nThe juice was clearly from concentrate. The Mexican and Salad sections were closed. What? No Mexican breakfast? Those are the best dishes! \n\nMiddle Eastern included bagels and lox. This was probably my favorite section. I forced fed myself lox with capers to get my money's worth. I liked the mozzarella and tomato salad, but it was something I could find at a supermarket deli. \n\nDessert section looked like it was filled with mini packaged pastries. I selected a chocolate croissant, but it was flaky and dry, so I skipped it. \n\nOn to the American section. There were 2 types of benedicts. They looked good, but I think they became overcooked from the heat lamp. The country style potatoes were good and surprisingly still crispy. I did however, find these potatoes repeated 2 more times. It also seemed like these were the seasoned potatoes you find in the freezer aisle. \n\nThere was an omelet station, that I skipped. And I think a crepe station in the Dessert section. \n\nStopped in the Asian section to get a squirt of sriracha. \n\nI stopped off for a cheese blintz, but never ate it. It was pretty burnt and didn't have much filling. The section also included French toast and pancakes?\n\nThere was a nice oatmeal/cream of wheat section. Then, a fresh fruit section where you could construct your own parfait. 2 yogurt flavors, shredded coconut and granola? 2 smoothie options. They were really plain. I think one was banana, the other, strawberry. \n\nThe final section included spinach and cheese egg scramble, but I didn't see any cheese or spinach. There were potato pancakes. And a turkey hash which had fingerling potatoes (yum) and roasted peppers. I took the time to dig out the pepper and fingerlings. This was one of the only things that didn't seem pre-made. And it was pretty good.  \n\nI looked through the photos for lunch and dinner and they all look like a completely different restaurant! I don't know, guess they dropped the ball for breakfast.

It was very bold and distinct and the subtleties of the smokiness withstood the nuanced flavors of the ramen broth. The waitress hovered over us, she wanted to make sure we had a good time and enjoyed our food. She almost followed us out the door when she said goodbye. \n\nThey try to do things a little different here at Ramen Misoya Tomi. The traditional, meticulous care is still put into the recipes and ingredients but added are the non-traditional, traditional recipes that we aren't familiar with. Did you follow that? \n\nThe decor could use a little improvement, I'm not a fan of the huge posters hanging about that tout the benefits of miso. Ambiance could be a little less perfunctory and a bit more fun, but what's great about this spot is that it's not too crowded so I'd recommend it for groups. It's hard to find a ramen spot to take big groups to because they are normally tiny places and packed to the brim. A group would fare fine here.",0

Everything else I have had there has been pretty amazing. Breakfast pizza has an egg on it... EGG! (If you like your eggs runny, order them sunny side up. The over easy eggs were overcooked) Also I love the sweet potato fries here. My favourite! \n\nThe wait staff is always super friendly. Always quick to pick up plates and refill glasses. I love the ambiance. Lovely little signage hanging on the wine rack: Wine a little, you'll feel better.

1847,0,"We decided to go here for Valentine's Day since my boyfriend saw that the sushi chef was on Dinner Impossible on the Food Network. They had a special V-day Menu which we decided to order from. The first course was the Tuna Cocktail, this was slightly seared tuna with a spicy BBQ sauce and cucumbers. The Tuna Cocktail was good so when the second course came out, I had the Lobster Miso soup and the BF had the Hot and Sour Soup...it was a disappointment. The Lobster was so overcooked that it was rubbery and hard to even swallow, the Hot and Sour Soup was overly spicy and nothing special. The third course included the New Zealand Lamb Chops which had a Coffee Mole Sauce and Butternut Squash or the Aburi Yellowtail. The Mole Sauce overpowered the Lamb Chops, but the Yellowtail was surprisingly delish. For the main course we decided to order the Sushi for two. It came with Tuna Sashimi,  Toro, Salmon, Kobe Nigri Sushi, Tiger Roll, Crunchy Roll and Tropicana Roll.  All the rolls were half rolls (about 4 pieces each) and the nigri was nothing special. For dessert, they provided a chocolate type wafer dessert with a rasberry puree...I didn't care for it very much but the BF thought it was ok. Overall, we were a bit disappointed by the fact that this was supposed to be the only Master Sushi Chef in Las Vegas, but the quality of the food was mediocre.

Please keep in mind this was my first time in montreal, my first time eating any sort of french food, and my first time ever eating escargot. The escargot was surprisingly good and was baked in a cheese and garlic mixture which I enjoyed very much.

Over 3 weeks in advance I put in an email inquiry stating that I had a Groupon and that I would like pricing for two different options. After 10 days of no response, I wrote again (they never answer the phone so after numerous attemps I resorted to email).\n\nIt was now inside the 2 week mark.  The owner, Lacia, claimed she never saw my email but then gave me a price quote. I responded with my order and a couple days later she said she would have an invoice sent to me with my balance.  The invoice did not come for another few days. It is now the Tuesday before my birthday which is on a Saturday. I happened to be traveling for work at the time and was unable to address it right away. On Thursday around noon I receive an email from her asking if I still wanted my cake because she hasn't seen the payment for the balance. By the way, at no time did she say there was a deadline for paying the invoice, just that it had to be paid before you picked up your cake.  Also, I thought it was pretty hilarious that she would take days up to a week or more to write back but if I didn't pay my invoice within 48 hours she suddenly gets very responsive.\n\nAnyway, I emailed her back immediately and said, yes, I still wanted my cake and that I would take care of the balance immediately. (Seriously??? I've been practically stalking you for a month to try and get this cake. Did you really think I would just change my mind less than a week before my birthday??)  I paid via the paypal link she sent and received confirmation of my payment at 1:40pm on Thursday.\n\nFast forward to that Saturday, my 30th birthday and the day of my party. I receive an email at 7:00am from Lacia (because everyone gets up at dawn on the day of their birthday, right?) stating that my payment didn't show up until late Friday night and so she took the day off because it's her son's birthday. (Really? Wow, what a coincidence, me too! That's why I'm trying to order a freaking cake) She said if I let her know right away she MIGHT be able to get it done in time for an evening delivery otherwise she would give me a refund.  Needless to say, I never got a cake delivered to my hotel that night nor have I received a refund despite requesting one three times.\n\nI'm sure you and your son had a wonderful day together and that he got to have an amazing cake.

The granola was some of the best I've had and everything else was pretty damn delicious too.  I washed mine down with coffee and water and Andrea had some OJ with hers... We sat outside for a while after we finished, talking, working, and taking in the fresh air.  The manager, Paul, came out to check on us, and he even helped me carry my computer inside once we decided we were ready to go... \n\nCaf\u00e9 Zuzu is especially convenient when staying at the Valley Ho, but I now see it as a local dining destination as well.  I'm already looking forward to that granola for breakfast next time I visit!",4

1861,0,"I have been taking my Yorkie/ Maltese and English Bulldog to Bark Place for almost a year and half. \nI have always been able to call and they have always been able to take one or both of my dogs (I don't always take my Bulldog) the same day which is super convenient! They are always ready for me when I arrive and they take the dogs right back. \n\nI have never had a problem with the grooming my dogs have received here. They have always done exactly what I have requested and I have never seen any knick marks or cuts on my dogs. \n\nThe last time I took in my Yorkie/ Maltese he was really over grown, because I thought he looked super cute as a long haired mutt and I just didn't want to get him a hair cut! But I finally felt so bad for him, despite how cute he looked, so I took him in. I was really impressed because they still charged the same $45 to have him completely clipped down! He looked like a whole new dog when they were done! \n\nMy only wish about Bark Place would be that they took debit cards. It might sound silly, but I never have cash on me.",2
1862,0,"Soo just a heads up, this place is closed to the public... but that's not why I give it 1 star.\n\nI had a Groupon that expired a while ago (October 2011).  HOWEVER, Groupon Terms & Conditions states that all Groupons, past their promotional period, are good for the amount purchased.  In my case, I had purchased two $15 Groupons for a total of $30.  \n\nI walk into this place at about 2:30pm on a Tuesday and see a sign out front: \""Closed to the Public.  Wholesale Only\"".  There were still a couple employees inside, so I walked in figuring they would let me redeem my voucher and move on with my life.... not the case.\n\nThe girl behind the counter immediately tells me that they are closed.  I explained that I had an expired Groupon that I needed to redeem.  She responded that the Groupon expired in 2010 and they would no longer honor it.  After checking my Groupon app, I commented back that it actually expired in 10/2011 and I just wanted to grab my $30 worth of merchandise, which they had to honor.  She again said no, stating that the store was closed.  I asked if she could make an exception since the store was still standing, with employees and clothing in it.  \""I told you I wouldn't make an exception\"" was her response.\n\nThat was it.  RUDE customer service.  I would never go back to this place if it were still open, which is sad because they had some cute items!\n\nBest of luck with future endeavors (you're going to need it), read the terms & conditions before you put out a Groupon!!!!  Please excuse me while I call Groupon for my refund.... tata b&*^hes!!!",0
1863,0,"I am a regular at about 3 Starbucks' locations here in town and this is by far the worst one. Yes, they are very busy, but this does not excuse the mediocre service and dirty tables on a regular basis. This location seems to be the preferred spot for local cabbies and you can almost always count on a 8-10 person line, which is fine and does not factor into my 2 star rating for this Starbucks. What DOES affect my rating are at the following\n\n1) Consistently dirty tables, floors, and restroom. You can almost always count on having empty cups, spilled milk/half and half, sugar, etc both on the tables and on the straw/napkin area. Seems like perhaps a lack of proper staffing and/or lack of awareness.\n\n2) Compared to other Starbucks, staff seems extremely smug and unhappy except for 2 or 3 employees. Yes, we know it's busy and this location is probably more difficult than other locations, but you have a great job and are consistently busy. \n\n3) Regardless of how complicated your drink is, you are PAYING good money for it. My drink is almost $7 and I have at least 5 per week. No other location has ever had an issue making it, yet here, \""Ben\"" the barista, seemed to have a problem with how the drink was ordered and when he called it out at the bar, he used a very smug and sarcastic tone which is NOT appreciated.

For the fries, make sure you get the waffle fries. They are absolutely delicious and complement the sandwiches completely.

My favorites were the steak in adobo and the chorizo shrimp tacos.  Though it's tapas, you actually get a good bit of food in each item.  My suggestion is to start with 2 plates per person and then build from there.  We over ordered, but it was amazing.\nWill definitely be back.",4

I ordered the regular bachi burger and it was alright. I wouldn't say that it is a must have. With the price I paid, I'd rather go to In N Out and have a whole combo with a drink and fries honestly. Maybe it was because we ordered to-go instead of sitting down for the meal and having drinks as well, but I think Bachi Burger is just okay.",2

Coffee was average.  \nI was a little disappointed to see they were getting rid of the military discount.  I would be curious to know why they aren't going to have that anymore.  A 20% discount is minimal considering the service they provide to our country.  Also, every time I've ever been at Aliante, it is crawling with service people.  It would seem to me, it'd be a better marketing strategy to get those large groups of people in, rather than not.  I'm sure it was an incentive to have them come in...without it, Aliante will just be another casino and the Original Pancake House is just another place to have breakfast.

I was told the portions were a good size so why would I even think about ordering more food especially when this is my very first time ordering from this place. I live less than 3 miles from this place you think they would make an exception for customers that are really close. The problem is that their delivery radius is too large ..

1900,0,"Not sure why I am even bothering to write a review. 300+ Yelpers have already beaten me to it but I like to read my own words almost as much as I like the sound of my own voice so here goes.\n\nESPN, Sports Illustrated, and a cornucopia of other publication's can't be (and aren't) wrong when they say PNC is the best park ion the country. In a field where contention and argumentation is not only normal, but necessary, when all the talking heads collaborate, you listen. (Sorry, I had to)\n\nFirst thing first, the view. There is not a better, more breathtaking view in any park in all of MLB. The Clemente and Warhol bridges traverse the background, as well as an amazing view of all the wonderful and unique architecture downtown has to offer. I always tell my out of town friends that the Highmark building is saying the Bucs are number one (or flipping the bird to the away team).\n\nThe food at PNC is top notch too. MLB is moving away from plain dogs, peanuts, and Crackerjacks as the palates of the average American get more and more sophisticated. The food at PNC is so good I always end up spending and eating Way-hay-hay-hay more than I ever intended. For me it ceases to be the 7th inning stretch and more like the 7th inning redistribute-the-food-baby. Also, for 40 bucks you can sit in the outfield and eat all the traditional ballpark grub you can cram down your throat.\n\nAll the staff at PNC are very nice. They have no reason not to be. Even when the Bucs are losing, everyone is polite, friendly, and energetic.\n\nPrice wise, you cannot beat PNC Park. I took some friends from New Jersey once. As soon as they figured out that that fresh smell was what air is SUPPOSED to smell like, they had a spit take looking at the money we were spending. Great seats, parking, and a round of beers for 5 guys was about 200 bucks. One of my friends told me that wouldn't cover parking at his beloved Yankee Stadium.\n\nTo sum up, I think we all know what PNC is about. The Bucs have given us a true gem on the North Shore. The view is amazing,  the food has gotten extremely good, and the price is more than acceptable. As much as it pains me to say I almost hope they start being terrible again so we don't see a ridiculous increase in prices.",4

1904,0,"Just got back from a stay at the Phoenician.   Although the resort was beautiful, I was thoroughly disappointed in their service and won't return. I don't take a lot of vacations but do like to stay at a top notch place when I do go. For me, the service is by far the most important aspect on my trips and I found the staff at the Phoenician lacking in that respect. We were given a mountain view room. Typically, when I hear a hotel advertise mountain versus pool view rooms, it's not a big deal to me (in fact, I'd prefer the mountain except if I'm in a coastal hotel with a view of the ocean). In this case though, what they mean by mountain is opening your shade and being right next to a mountain (so close you can tell the bugs on the bushes). So essentially, you don't really have a view. That wasn't the greatest, but the bigger problem was I had no phone reception on half of the room and the other half I was only able to get one bar (clearly a result of being right next to a mountain). We went to the NCAA basketball game on our first day in town so we weren't in the room much. The next morning, I went down to use the fitness facility and found it to be sub-par for a hotel of the level of the Phoenician (needed a serious refresh...they have a bunch of antiquated machines and spin bikes). I asked the concierge if she knew of a track nearby (figured I'd just go for a jog instead since I didn't like the fitness center). She had some maps laid out for jogs on the complex but I informed her that running on asphalt takes its toll on my knees and that I really needed a track. I asked if there was a college nearby and she directed me to ASU, but gave me bad directions (had me turn right on Camelback and it should have been left). I drove for about 35 minutes and never came across the first street that I was supposed to turn on (Scottsdale Blvd). So that wasted over an hour of my time for nothing. As I kept having calls drop off on my phone, I became more annoyed with the situation and by Saturday morning complained to the front desk. The snooty clerk replied..\""well sir, we can't do anything about the way the hotel is constructed\"". I thought to myself, so what are you saying?...your customers have to suck it up and deal with it? I would think a more professional clerk would have apologized for the inconvenience and immediately look to switch my room (instead of me telling the clerk that this wouldn't do). So I had the room switched but it wasn't available yet (it was 7am). He said I would receive a call informing me when the room was ready. By 12:30, we hadn't received a call and had to leave for the game so I called the front desk. The clerk said to leave our packed luggage on the bed and it would be moved for us to the new room by the time we got back. We arrived back at the hotel at 5. The new room was ready but the luggage hadn't been moved (they said they would take care of it right away). So we went to the bar for a little over an hour. We got back to the room...still no luggage. I called back to the desk and the clerk apologized and said it would be done right way). After another hour and still no luggage, I went to the desk and complained (we had 8 o'clock dinner reservations at a restaurant away from the hotel and needed to change clothes). We finally received our luggage just before 7:30 and needless to say didn't really have time to freshen up a bit before dinner (actually just got to the restaurant at 8). Although the front desk manager apologized the next day, it really didn't matter to me at that point. She asked what she could do to make me happy and offered to comp a massage or a free meal. I just asked if it was possible to get an \""uneventful\"" day from her staff (which was really all I wanted all along). She had a look on her face like she didn't even know how to respond to that request (as though that might be asking the impossible). I mentioned that I really didn't think I was asking too much to have our luggage delivered and perhaps her staff could have at least made sure we had some ice (they don't have ice machines so we had to call room service for ice). She was surprised by the ice comment and questioned whether we had had turn down service (apparently the maids are supposed to deliver ice every night). I informed her we never received ice in the 3 nights we had been there and I had to call for it (and of course, tip their room service which I thought was bogus). She did end up comping our lunch but honestly it just didn't matter. I can't stand it when a 5 star hotel provides shoddy service like this. There are plenty of deals out there especially with the economy being in the shape it's in (even for 5 star hotels). My wife actually chose the hotel (I was pushing for the Four Seasons). The last day at the hotel was our 25th wedding anniversary, but I was just too annoyed to really enjoy it. Too bad the staff doesn't realize they ruin people's stays when they can't deliver a quality experience.",0

1907,0,"I came here with Kelly C. after purchasing a Groupon to try this place out. It had really good reviews so I was excited to try a new painting. We are no strangers to BYOB instructor driven painting, so perusing a new calendar was fun. \n\nWe decided on the abstract painting, because it didn't look difficult and can be modified with the colors. Our class size was small, I think there were 9 of us, and everyone was really positive. I don't like it when people think too much about where things go, just have more wine, and paint! \n\nOur instructor, was ok. I can tell that she paints a lot in her free time. She told us that the picture wasn't meant to be put on the calendar, but the owner liked it so much. Because she painted it at home, I don't think she was thinking about just how she would teach the class. She had a bit of a difficult time explaining how she got to where she did at which point. She also didn't finish her painting, which was strange. \n\nOur class was very independent and didn't need to be coddled, but I just think it could have been more instructional. She was nice, and I liked the studio, I just don't think the teaching style is for me.",0

1909,0,"Came here with my boyfriend the next night after having a negative experience at another buffet. It was the father's day special so we paid around $43 per person, with a wine tasting an additional cost. Since we went before it closed around 9pm we only had to wait to be seated for about 15-20 minutes. As soon as we were seated we were told to start and that our server would take our order for drinks as soon as we came back with our first plate. \n\nThe food was great and the variety made it almost impossible to not find something you like. As mentioned in previous reviews, a large majority of the dishes are served on individual plates which helps control portion size. Definitely try the mac and cheese, for us we had the lobster. It was neat to try dishes I've never had; quail, au grautin potatoes with truffle oil, different kinds of risottos, ect. I recommend starting on the far left with the appetizers buffet and moving to the right through meats, pastas, pizza, and eventually Asian food. Of course end with desert which is overwhelming, but does not lack variety in options. \n\nGo.",0

1911,0,"I had a really good meal at the bar here on a recent trip to the Valley of the Sun.  I've eaten at the Del Frisco's in Charlotte many times and was aware of the Grille concept the chain was rolling out but this was my first chance to frequent one of the Grille's.\n\nThis location is an easy walk, just down the street, from the Phoenix Ritz-Carlton.  The main restaurant was packed but the bar was a perfect place for a lone dude on the prowl (JUST KIDDING HONEY!) so I took a seat.  I was promptly greeted even though the bar was pretty crowded and within a minute had a drink and a menu in my hand.\n\nI ordered the Wedge salad and just like at a regular Del Frisco's, it was drenched in that oh so damn good blue cheese dressing and had crumbled up pieces of their awesome bacon on top.  For the main event I got the Prime Double Cheeseburger and I can truly say it was one of the better burgers I've ever eaten.  Two juicy, flavorful patties, American cheese, some kind of delicious mayonnaise based sauce, lettuce, tomato, red onion, pickles.  A great balance of savory, fatty, acid, soft, crunchy, etc, etc... \n\nAll in all, this visit left me longing for a version of the chain here in the QC.  Del Frisco's quality food at a cheaper price point.  That's a lot to like!  And, if you do want a big ole prime steak, you can still go that direction.  What a country!",3

1913,0,"I am a HUGE Pottery Barn fan. HUGE! Their furniture pieces are timeless and made to last. You won't find veneer wood here. Solid heavy pieces that are made to last. My tester; go up to any piece and start shaking it, if it moves so should you to the next item. I like my furniture sturdy, unbreakable. \n\nSo with that being said, why a 2 star here for this store in particular? The service! Actually the store manager truth be told. It's like the case of Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman. Yes I dress pretty \""comfortable\"" on weekends and I could be mistaken for a 15 year old without a job, but I am still a customer. A customer who just moved in a new house and needs to fill up his house slowly.  So when I frequently get snubbed for more affluent looking customers, I just  peruse the floor samples and get what I want at Pottery Barn Henderson or online. \n\nIn my profession, don't judge a book by it's cover. Treat everyone like family and they will treat you like family.",0
1914,0,"This isn't the greatest costco I have ever been too. I have a few issues with it. The parking can get pretty bad but that is most costcos so I just go with it. \n\nI love costco because of their samples. That is my favorite part and the marketing usually works well on me. I almost always end up buying something I sampled. This costco just has the worst samples I have experienced. The sample service is so slow. They always run out of samples right away and then they start making the next batch. This process is not effiecnt and frustrating. Yes, I know what you are thinking- They are free, why am I complaining? Its because samples are a big part of my costco experience. I have been to other costcos where there samples are running like a well oiled machine and they are passing them out left and right.\n\nAnother problem I have is the car wash. It does a great job washing the outside of my car, but there is nothing to do with my inside. I need vacuums! What car wash does not provide vacuums? \n\nI do enjoy getting beer and wine there. I love the large costco size vodkas and what not. I also recently found out about their discount restaurant cards which are nice. \n\nSo basically, I will continue to go but will scowl when the wait between samples is 10 minutes. Feeed me costco!",0
1915,0,"The only time it is justifiable to go to the Blue Martini is during happy hour and even then the wait sometimes makes it not worth the half price martinis. \n\nOne birthday, I thought it would be a great idea to try half of their martinis in one night. The signature blue martini is delicious, if you like an AMF, you would love this drink. Most of their martinis are just variations of mixed drinks. The only one that I would suggest avoiding is the Almond Joy because the coconut irritated my throat. \n\nThe food here is nothing special. If you can hold out, go to Yardhouse for dinner and beer at their happy hour. Remember, beer before liquor never been sicker. Liquor before beer, you're in the clear.",0
1916,0,"Full disclosure: the food was 3 stars, maybe 4. Unfortunately this is a one-star review because we literally had the WORST WAITER ever.\n\nWe were seated quickly. Water and menus appeared. Waiter was not overly friendly, but not callous yet. We ordered a burger and a chicken sandwich. Again, the food was pretty good. Overpriced, but that's par for the course in Vegas.\n\nSadly, the waiter was totally inattentive. He disappeared for long stretches of time, avoided eye contact when walking by, made no effort to check on us when the food took a long time to come out, or to ask us how it was afterward. He gave us the check without asking if we wanted dessert, which is a big no-no in my book. He practically growled when he spoke. He was just super grumpy and obviously didn't want to be there. \n\nSave yourself the headache and eat at Pink's.",0
1917,0,"This place is great! It is a little on the pricey side for the evening admission (the day time is without monsters and just a walk through) there is a guy out front that hands out a $5 discount, so it's manageable. I asked if there was anything we could do for additional discount because it was my friend's 30th birthday. They couldn't do an additional discount, but they gave us a few 2-for-1 drink discounts. The place was a lot of fun too, it's a decent walk through, with a lot of attention to detail. The actors are really fun and really get into their characters. They're not afraid to be rude to you and fully get into things. A lot of places that do stuff like this hold back, but this one was really a lot of fun. I know some people say it's not worth the price, but if this is the sort of thing you are into you'll appreciate the acting and the details and it IS in fact worth it. Also, the people running it are SUPER nice and awesome. My friend and I both bought a picture at the end and they printer was having issues, so we only got the first picture out and they were working on the printer. It was closing and I felt bad, so I asked if I could just pay the difference and get a hat. They just let me have the hat, mind you, the second picture is only $5 extra and a hat is like $20. So my friend and I leave and we're like 8 stores down the line as they come running out to us because they got the printer working and gave us our picture. So we got a hat for free and they RAN out and found us to give us the picture. I've never had service that nice ANYWHERE. I totally recommend this place, for the scares, the atmosphere, and the AWESOME people!",2

Thanks for your time and efforts, and sweet demeanor April!!!\n\nWe got there after the Cosmo Limo picked us up from the airport. Dusty was gracious, and provided us with a welcoming experience.\n\nWe then got there early (9:00AM), early, and didn't have  room yet, but were able to check in. We already planned on spa day, and so had reservations for mani/pedi, scrub, spa-ing all day (See Sahra Spa review).\n\nWe had our fill, but not before taking amazing pics of the dogs and the stilettos in the foyers.\n\nWe then went to lunch at the Wicked spoon...awesome! What fresh farm to table cuisine, lots of fresh veggies, and fruits concocted in the most amazing presentations, with such dishes that I will try to find and order o the internet!  I am picky about eating fresh, raw veggies with my meals, and I just adored the gratifying steamed and lightly steamed veggies Wicked Sppon offered as part of the entree, and even as an entree...\n\nWe then went to the Spa to have a Shellac Mani-Pedi, and Salt Total Body scrub. There was some patron there trying to convince us in the steam room that we should have spent our money elsewhere i.e Aria, but beware of competition in the form of blondie girls looking to lure you!! Weird!! I know!!!\n\nWe went to the spa, the cold plunge, steam room, sauna...see my review under Sahra Spa!\n\nWe then went to our room. I paid for a 1 bedroom suite, but April (my sweet concierge) decided to upgrage us to a Bellagio Fountain View (OMG). I ordered a dozen mylan balloons to be there for my twin sis, and a delish fruit basket, thanks for setting it up, including our bags.\n\nThat night we got ready and went directly to Encore for La Reve!!!! Super Duper!!! You HAVE to see it!!!\n\nWe came back, stood in line at Marquee for about an hour...a little flirting got us NO where, so we left and went to Bond...see my review there...LOVED it!!\n\nWe then went back to Marquee...slipped the \""guy with the clipboard\"" a $20 and got in to the front of the line....IT WAS 2:20 BY NOW, FYI, and the lines were outrageous...we danced our souls away until 5:00AM, and OMG did we have an amazing early birthday celebration in Vegas...\n\nI can't wait to come back...I'll definitely come back just with my twin too!!\n\nLook out for us!!",0

1920,0,"I regret even having to give this place one star. This was a horrible place to eat. The salad bar was appalling with hardly any salad or food . The food that had been sitting out there was luke warm. But of course we were there for the meat so we waited. After they brought out a few rounds of fatty white/dark meat chicken they finally brought out a rough beef jerky like slice of beef. That was the last semi-good piece of meat we got. Everything else, round after bloody round was dripping rare. When we complained to the owner after two hours we got no help. We did get an angry Brazilian with a knife come to tell us that we didn't have anything to complain about because we didn't make reservations. (There were three tables with ppl in them). When we were finally done waiting for meat that was edible we had to ask for the check (which was full price by the way). $84 dollars for some ice berg lettuce and a lot of dinner rolls. We were never offered a discount or coupon to come back and we complained at the end too. This was a really really bad experience. Lol, the lady who is commenting can't even take some honest criticism and try to make her place better. This is so professional. Maybe this is why the Italian restaurant of the same name shut down? I never once complained about the price, I have been to a lot better places than this one claims to be. I also consider myself to be pretty patient. All I wanted was some steak, at a steak house, it should not have been this hard haha. Well, for me, this is just one night. Unfortunately for this poor woman, it's her whole life.",0

A french rolled filled with very tasty meat, onions, mushrooms, and an alfredo/gravy sauce...all sealed in the bread by some provolone baked on top.\n\nThe place is big and clean, and the location is easy to get to(only a block off the 202).

Saw someone slip and hit their head - an ambulance was called to take her to the hospital for a concussion. \n\nThe ratio of pool guest to lifeguards seems to be 3:1.  \n\nEach time there is an injury instead of taking the person up to the first aid room all 50 guards blow their whistles and corral every single guest out of the pool and the entire pool area.  You are not allowed to find your children or grab your towels or even a water!  It's an absurd practice.  I will not return.  I agree that if the guards are dealing with an emergency people should get out of the pool but to corral everyone off the grounds is a bit much.,0

The server was really nice. \n\nWe ordered 3 Small Combo Beef Special Pho, 1 Large Brisket Pho, and Eggrolls as an appetizer.\n\nThe eggrolls arrived and there was nothing special. The eggrolls just came with lettuce. There were no mints, pickled carrots/radishes, and cilantro. I was extremely disappointed. But, I was super hungry and ate it anyway.\n\nThe Pho is just OKAY. I added a bunch of sauce to make my Pho taste just right. There was plenty of meat and it filled me up.\n\nThe Bill came and I saw the Eggrolls were charged at $5.25.

Therefore, this incident ruined my experience at Da Lat and I won't be going back. Sorry! \n\nAfter I found out, lettuce was extra. I made sure using my credit card didn't cost extra just in case I was SURPRISED again. \n\nI don't care I got charged 75 cents.

After sitting there for an hour after ordering to only have the waitress stop  by maybe four times each time because we had to call her over, and each time it seemed to be a hassle for her because she was so busy.  Which was funny because   the waitresses were all running around like crazy.  However, they never seemed to be carrying anything and they were definitely not carrying our drinks.  It was almost like Yuengling meant \""thank you but we're fine, don't come back for a half hour\"" in a foreign language.\n\nWe were finally fed up so I asked for our check, we were going to be leaving, which I have never done before, when our waitress said she'd check on it.

I usually use a level 2 bed which carries a max of 20 minutes and gives me a nice color.\n\nI went in today to buy a new package after taking a 6 month hiatus from tanning, and the sales associate was incredibly helpful. She took her time pulling about five bottles of lotion off the shelves and explaining all their different qualities and price points; she was very knowledgeable and I really appreciated her doing that. She didn't just pressure me in to buying the most expensive lotion they offer. \n\nDarque Tan offers monthly memberships as well as pre-paid packages; I use the $33.88/month package that allows for unlimited tans in level 1 and 2 beds at any DT location.\n\nThe only reason I didn't give five stars is because their lotions are pretty pricey. I bought a \""middle of the road\"" lotion with bronzers and DHA properties and it ran me $92, but they are offering a special right now that purchasing a lotion gives you money credited back to your account for upgrades.",2

We wanted to sit outside and saw there were many people sitting outside at The Beer Market so figured it was somewhere to be. We went in and had to find a server to see if we could sit outside. She said that it was self seating and we could sit anywhere. \n\nWe proceeded to the table outside and she brought us menus. She explained that they have a large selection of beer and no kitchen, but that you could bring your own food, which was a really cool concept. My friends were beer drinkers but I am not so they do have a limited selection of wine which was great. Our two friends joined us shortly after we were seated and we had to flag down a server to get them drinks. After sitting there for a good while a different server came over to check on us, which was confusing because our original server continuously checked on the table next to us. After sitting there even longer, we all had finished our drinks and no one came over. We had to find our server again to close our tab. \n\nWe weren't high maintenance customers, but did expect more attention since they are only serving beer. We assumed our server didn't pay attention to us because we weren't ordering as much as the table next to us, but there's no excuse for poor service. \n\nCool concept, but many other places around with better service to go to.",2

Plop! See through plastic bags of shrimp, mussels, crawfish, lobster, will be thrown on the table and your mission begins. It's an exported Louisiana style dining experience! I recommend getting the Hot n Juicy sauce, at mild spiciness. It's by far the tastiest and their mild spicy level has a deceivingly strong kick. This is for garlic lovers only, and is not a low sodium meal!\n\nThis year the crawfish were smaller and out of season, so they were made from frozen and not as fresh. The shrimp were large and excellent as always, and served with the head on. Mmm, brains. For mussels order the green mussels over the black, they will be larger and more flavorful. \n\nGreat for groups and sharing, but also fun for a date with some hands on eating!",0

The bouncers (not all of them but most) treat you like some bum off the street.\nI have been around the Scottsdale nightlife scene for 7+ years, so I know lots of people including club owners, etc and a few calls and VIP and in is no problem, but that's not my style because personally I think VIP is cheesy and has mostly wanna be people. Can't tell you how many times I have walked out of VIP after being invited in. Would rather hang outside VIP any day.\n\nAnyway back to the \""W\"". On the soft-opening they had in September I went to the \""W\"". A few people gathered around the door and not super busy inside so I figured I would just wait. Well after the door guy letting in a million people, he would not let me in. Was not like I had a crowd with me, I was solo, and I was dressed very upscale. So before I left I asked him his name just for the record, small world and I give people only one chance. I went around the other entrance, I knew the door guy and was in. Walked around for 10 minutes saw all the people who go to these openings to be seen, ran into some people I knew and left. Nothing worse than hanging out in a room of fake \""worried about how the world views them\"" people. All trying to emulate some sort of social status.\n\nThe prices seemed decent, Mondrian started charging $6 for a Bud Light then you add $1 for tip its $7. There is a difference between expensive and just plain gouging. I think \""W\"" is still good on this area.\n\nA few weeks later went back and though there was no over the top scrutinizing at the door but it still had that bad unfriendly attitude.\nThe atmosphere around the pool is cool and the architecture is cool. So if your into that check it out but be ready for the \""Kent Dorfman's\"" doormen deciding your fate if you can come in or not.\n\n\nI'll probably give the place another chance but right now it scores low.",0

I could look past all of that, but the thing that got me is how slooooowwww the service is. We ordered fairly quickly and the it took forever for the food to come out.

Again, not a huge selection (and get early - the amount of food is limited), but something unique, different - and definitely has a strong community vibe going on. \n\nIt seems like the folks at 720 aren't afraid to experiment a bit.

I'd heard things about the prices - but  apparently there was some sort of sale going on and I was able to gather a plethora of puppy goodies for not a lot of dough. Everything seemed to be one sale! My puppy, needless to say, was very happy with me.\n\nMy one real qualm with this place was that we needed a dog tag, paid for a dog tag, and when we stuck it in the machine for the engraving, it came with a mandatory Petsmart logo. Sure, it may be genius advertising in disguise, but the idea that I'm paying the same thing I would online and Petsmart gets to sneak in a bit of free advertising makes me all snarly, especially when I'm subjecting my new beloved pet to be the billboard. Low blow, Petsmart; low blow.\n\nAside from that, I loved the product selection and the employees were friendly and very helpful. I also kinda dug the pet classes they held here, although I would love to see something more communal and less profit-based in the downtown Phoenix vicinity. Definitely go when they're having their sales; the prices for dog toys had been marked from $7-9 bucks per toy down to $2-4 bucks, and that in my book, is pretty OK.",4

I am a really good customer at Morris Costumes in this location: 4300 Monroe Rd. Charlotte, however during  my last visit I was very taken aback by the woman (older woman) that owns the store.  You have to ask to try on the wigs behind the counter, so I did and then I proceeded to put the wig on and look at it in the mirror by the dressing room. The owner came over and said to the young girl manning the booth \""Watch her\"" as I was trying on the wig in a tone as if I was going to walk off with it!!!!  First of all I am a grown woman who is a faithful shopper, probably one of their best, I have 2 kids and I am a business owner myself why on earth would she ever get the impression I was going to steal her wig is beyond me!  I would never do that and didn't give her any reason what so ever to think I would!  She said it loud and embarrassed me and made me feel like a criminal.  I said, \""don't worry I am not going to steal your wig\"" and that made her get even more of an attitude and she said \""I don't want someone like you shopping here, leave\""  OMG never in my life has something so surreal like this ever happen to me. The woman sorry to say is delusional.  Not a good vibe with friendly customer service in there, they just eagle eye you thinking the worst which is unfortunate because they had some good items but it makes you not want to give your money to such a crazy person. Although the store is big it's not the \""IT\"" store to go to for costumes, she should be careful because now a days there is a lot of competition out there with Halloween stores opening, so why be treated like that and why support her and give her your hard earned money when you can go somewhere else?

1974,0,"Meh. I have to say I've had way better, I've seen worse. This hotel was a cheap late night find off of I-10 as we traveled from California to Texas. The staff was pleasant enough, the building/rooms old but looked to be recently remodled. I do not really like hotels that are open to the outside, meaning the entry doors face out into the elements. (I prefer the entry to rooms enclosed within secured buildings.) So this made me nervous because the areas away from the lobby are not wel lit and dark. The room looked clean but very tired in my opinion with dark, worn carpet; yellowed, dirty switch plates and typical economy hotel dressings. The bathroom was freshly updated with tile, new coats of paint (in main room too), and new fixtures. But, the bathroom was not spacious at all and left a claustorphobic feeling. The clothes closet was more of a nook with a rod which was a first for me to see in a hotel... Kind of corny and cheap. The water though was nice and hot and the tub sparkly clean. The beds were firm but comfortable enough to sleep on and had stacks if feather pillows - NOT my favorite options from hotels though for sanitary reasons. The room had standard furniture with a nice HD LCDtv. The microwave was great but the fridge not very cold. The a/c was odd to control and did not want to stay on at the temp I selected (colder) but fortunately it was a cool night and we were cool enough to sleep. This room was not \""horrible\"" but I just couldn't get past a dirty vibe and I personally was not at ease with the room. Like, I cringed at the idea of walking barefoot across the carpet- even though I am sure the carpet was vaccumed (too dark to tell). And, I wondered if I might wake up to bedbugs. (Envoked paranoia) So that said, the hotel is probably what you would expect from a cheaper economy standpoint but I definitely DEFINITELY would not opt to stay at this place again.",2

My caprese was good, but I don't think you can really mess that up, steak sandwich was chewy and a bit fatty.  My sisters short rib and grits, well the grits were okay but I am not a grit eater so hard to know what's good.  BUt the short ribs were sooo dry, belch.\n\nSo at this point we are just done and want to get out.  We ask for the check when we can finally flag the server down, then we set it out immediately on the corner of the table.  No joke he walked by at least 5 times and ignored it.  Service seems to be an issue at other places from this restaurant group, so I guess its not something they care about.  But when the food just isn't up to par either, well 3 strikes and they are out.  I can honestly say I will be just fine heading to other places in the area and not thinking twice about Nolen Kitchen in the future.",0
1985,0,"Out of the four major malls here (Galleria, Meadows, Fashion Show), this is my least favorite. But there are some saving graces: Old Navy, Yankee Candle, the Pet Store, some promotions if you join the e-club. And I almost forgot Marshall's- just outside of the old Dillard's location.\n\nThere are a lot of empty store space up for lease.One wing looks pretty depressing. Once, with my husband, I counted about 25 empty slots! We went again this I don't think that count includes the food court. **UPDATE 7/24/10- part of the mall where a lot of the stores vacated, has been officially closed off, after Frederick's, making that wing feel even smaller (kinda like an Alice in Wonderland feeling) and more depressing, for that matter. At least, we actually went shopping here at several different stores- Game Stop, FYE, Macy's, and Old Navy. Sadly, the Pet Store closed! The McDonald's is still closed at the food court. Now, the other half is closed, due to renovations.\n\nIt's pretty crowded on Black Friday due to the department store sales and promotions. My last few trips here were pretty quick- a few stores and I was out of there. It's convenient if you're doing some shopping in the area- lots of shopping in the surrounding strip malls on Maryland Parkway.",2
1986,0,"This was the worst experience I have ever had not only with a place to stay, but the customer service as a guest here.\n\nDo. Not. Come. Here. For. Any. Reason. Under. The. Sun.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause my boyfriend and I were UNLAWFULLY kicked out and they voided their OWN contract and fine-print that they made us sign/initial!\n\nMy boyfriend basically told me Monday morning  (7/22/13) he was going to go to the front office to renew his wifi. When he got there, he spoke to the two same teenage girls that helped us get set-up in the place the previous week.  Come to find out, because of the billing and credit card situation being odd, because of our property manager paying for everything, he wasn't able to renew the wifi for another week at $5 because they were going to have to have the property manager call the front desk to allow them to charge the same credit card.  It was a pain because it is really hard to get a hold of anyone with property management and come to find out, we were staying there for two weeks and they only paid for one!  My boyfriend in pure frustration after hearing this, grabs his phone in anticipation of calling our property manager and mutters to himself \""son of a bitch.\""  That was a statement made TO HIMSELF.  One of the young girls jumped on that, stating, \""Excuse me?\"" My boyfriend immediately came back with, \""..What?\"" because he didn't know what she was talking about. \n\nRather than being a stand-up, normal person, she immediately took offense and asked him rudely, \""Did you just call me a stupid bitch?\"" From what my boyfriend told me, he immediately said no, stating he was frustrated at the fact that he had to \""call these people again\"" and apologized for making it seem like he was directly insulting her. Rather than taking the apology, she calls her manager over, acting angry stating my boyfriend called her a stupid bitch.\n\nThis is where it all gets very messed up.\n\nThis manager decides to go off on my boyfriend totally out of the blue, and I quote from him, \""She walks over and starts asking me 'Who do you think you are fucking insulting my employee'\"", he tells me that again he repeats himself stating it wasn't meant to be an insult and he was cussing to himself. He tried telling her he wasn't threatening her employee and he apologized for the language and she stated \""to not use that god damn language in her office\"". He told her that we hadn't been paying for our room for the past week BECAUSE of the management company, to this she responds, \""You don't have to worry about the rent, you need to pack up your shit and go.\"" When he protested, considering that was like an 18-wheeler randomly hitting someone, she pulled out her cellphone and threatened my boyfriend saying she was going to call Metro (the police) on him if he didn't leave immediately. He comes back to our room stating the situation. I, immediately, know it is a miscommunication because I KNOW for a fact my boyfriend does NOT treat anyone so disrespectfully. When I go to speak to this manager face to face, I am treated like shit on her shoe with her telling me I have thirty minutes to pack my \""shit\"" and get out. So, we do. Mind you, my property manager also tried to speak to her via the phone, to no avail! Apparently she's highly offended by cursing in her office - enough to evict someone in half an hour!\n\nWe were inside our room with our stuff finally packed to go (waiting for a taxi) when a person with courtesy patrol knocks on the door and tells us that we have to vacate the room because he's locking it up. That to me seemed normal, regardless of the terrible circumstances.  To make it WORSE, after he leaves and we're sitting on the steps with three overly stuffed garbage bags of groceries and stuffed to the brim suitcases, he comes back stating - and I QUOTE - \""You must have pissed someone off, because 'they' want you off of the property.\"" My boyfriend and I were SPEECHLESS! We were THROWN TO THE CURB!\n\nWe found out later the manager's name is Dana and that this is NOT the first time she has treated people this way. In a few examples (per tripadvisor), people were given a written eviction notice for no reason at all. One person stating, \""--New Manager Dana Alexander comes in and makes her own rules. Totally not in the rules and regulations. I thought maybe the corporation might wanna know how bad shes treating the costumers there so I wrote a letter. 3 days after, she brings a 7 day eviction letter.\"" After all of this, we called her district and regional managers and NO ONE even cares! Their excuse was that \""they operate as a hotel for the first 30 days\"" so that, by NV standards, excuses them and makes what she did legal. \n\nIf Dana and those girls read this one day, you are all low down and DO NOT deserve your job! Anyone and everyone headed to this place, RUN FOR THE HILLS! We did NOT deserve to be treated like animals and we did not deserve to be at the mercy of a person that is such a control freak that abuses her power.",0

After waiting an hour (due to computers being down and they had to do everything by hand, they said) I saw the Physicians Assistant for about 7 minutes.  My bill was $295!  They heavily promote this as an affordable alternative to the emergency room based on the price, which they state is $200!  No where on their site do they mention their base visit is $295 (which is what the billing dept told me when I called them). I would not recommend this urgent care to anyone - there was nothing urgent or affordable about it!",0

They even had a good selection of Numero Group albums, the incredible soul and funk label out of Chicago.  As other reviewers have pointed out, you can get tickets to pretty much any indie show in the city here at face value. They'll charge you a slight fee for paying with credit, but it's still the cheapest place to stock up on tickets. The guys who work here are super helpful and didn't mind one bit that we didn't French.  I wished I lived closer so I could visit more often. Highly recommended.",3

There was no line out the door but once I opened it, it was like New Year's Eve on the Vegas Strip! Well, it was nothing new to me as this is a common occurence in my  home town. \n\nThe hostess tells us that the wait was gonna be around 45min - 1hr. So, I squeezed my  way to the bar and ordered the infamous brunch beverage - Mimosa. About 10 minutes later, I was still thirsty, so I ordered a Tangerine Mimosa. I never tried this combination before and I must say it was Awesome! Finally, get seated, about 40 minutes later, and by  this time I practically  memorized half the menu. \n\nAndy's Sage Fried Chicken..: Served on a Big plate, Stacked architecturally sound and I couldn't wait to have a bite! The chicken, bacon mashed potaotes, eggs, biscuit.. Everything just worked and was more than filling!\n\nFrench Toast: Another Enormous dish! Extra Thick bread with galloping amounts of pecan maple syrup and pieces of banana. It wasn't Great but not Bad either.\n\n\nKiwi Watermelon Lemonade: Awesome combination and  came with a Fat slice of Watermelon as its garnish.\n\n\nConsidering the long wait, the Alright tasting food, the Claim Jumper sized portions and the Great drinks.. I can't say I'd be back for a second round. I can only vouch for the generosity of food and the beverages at most..",4

The pick up times are sporadic at best.... who wants to wait 2-3 hours for a shuttle? the Taxi will cost $40 w/o tip. When you see the M Resort offer anything \""complimentary\"", its NOT. At best, its a 2 for 1 offer.  Forget the buffet if your time means anything to you.... we stood 15 minutes and moved, I'm not joking, 4 feet! We arrived looking forward to relaxing at their gorgeous pool only to be told that the area is closed through March. We tried to get a glass of wine at the Hostile Grape; oops, closed 3 days a week!

1997,0,I've been looking for a decent mexican restaurant in Tempe. I drove by this place many times on my way to school. I really like mexican food and grew up around many mexican folks who were great cooks. So it's safe to say that I can be pretty picky. \n\nThe decor here is just kind of odd in a funny way. It's not necessarily bad it just strikes me as kind of funny. The food is great. I love the salsa here and find it spicy enough. I like to get their special called tres amigos. It's very filling and tasty.  The service has always been good and the food fresh. Overall a good find and pretty good food.,2
1998,0,"This place gets low reviews for their yogurt.  I came here specifically for their crepes and specifically for the savory crepes, the pepperoni and cheese and the ham and cheese.  At about $9.50 they're a bit expensive, but they do provide a good portion.  I was expecting smaller portions.  I had two and was completely full.  The largest crepe I ever had was from a Middle Eastern vendor in Paris and only one filled with ground beef did the job to fill me up for the day.  So just saying, a single crepe here can do the job of filling you up for dinner.  The ham was all tiny diced up and tasteless but the cheese made up for it.  Can't say anything about the yogurt, but it was a decent creperie, kind of like the Subway of crepes, not exactly gourmet crepes.",2
1999,0,"Could not find 0 stars. Got one of there flyer's on the door and decided we were desperate enough to try this place for their spaghetti, meatballs and pizza. Boy, what a mistake!!!! The food was promised in 30 to 45 minutes and arrived in just a hair under 2 hours. Lets start with the food had a weird smell to it. Now we opened the spaghetti. It was cold, extremely dry, flavorless, the noodles were dried out like they were cooked yesterday. In their menu it states they \""only use the finest quality imported pasta\"". BULL $HIT. If they did, they imported it cooked already. Now for the meatballs, low grade hamburger meat cooked in grease with absolutely, I mean absolutely no seasoning or flavoring and small, way to small for the price of them. The pizza was dry, crust was hard as a rock, cold and the pizza smelled & tasted like one of those frozen pizzas you get from the supermarket. The toppings besides the pepperoni was sparse, a light sprinkling of about a half a hand full for a 24\"" pie. And guess what the soda that came with the meal was warm. Warmer then the pizza and spaghetti. We called back to get a refund, and the manager (or some flunkie with a fake foreign accent (wasn't quite Italian, maybe Greek)) gives us a bunch of lip about how their food is cooked fresh. After about 10 minutes of bickering back and forth, the \""manager\"" claimed that all his food is frozen. Gee, hence the freezer taste of everything. We finally had to drive to their location and surrender our food (which was fine, it was stinking up the house) and got a refund. YUCK YUCK YUCK with a serving of YUCK. Buyer beware.",0

A friend & I dropped in to this location a couple of days ago & each ordered an \""Ultimate Supreme\"" pizza, at only $8 each for a large, \""Hot & Ready!\"".  Friends, it got home still hot, & it was DELICIOUS!!  Was it as good as a $20 pizza at your favorite place in the Valley?  Maybe not, but I bet it was 80% as good for 40% of the price!  After eating half, it also reheated well (in the toaster oven, not the microwave) for a couple of snacks the next day.\n\nI strongly assert that the pizza here is better than that at Papa John's, Pizza Hut, Numero Uno or Dominoes, the primary competitors (who all actually charge somewhat more).\n\nNeed to spend less?

After walking through the casino floor (Planet Hollywood, I believe), we were promptly seated. Our waitress was lovely. We ordered some pancakes and were told that the $6.99 deal was only on weekdays. Really? The huge flashing banner doesn't say that (we checked on the way out, too. Unless it's in tiny writing on the following \""advertisement\"". Who knows). Anyhow, we kinda felt we were lured in here under false pretenses. But as long as we were there, we decided to have breakfast, s the menu is enormous, with tons of selections. I just ordered a poached egg (I can't eat much), but the family ordered granola and fruit, and granola with yogurt with fruit. And they LOVED their dishes. It was fairly healthy, large (but not grossly huge) portions, and tasty. \n\nMy egg was great (but it's rather hard to mess up that order...!).\n\nBreakfast was so good, in fact, that we returned the following morning. Being a weekday (Monday), one kid ordered the all-you-can-eat pancakes. The rest of us had the same meals as the day prior. The pancakes were so big that my kid barely ate the first plate presented her; forget about more! They were fluffy and good. The waitress, who was also nice, said that few people ordered more. This time we were seated in a different area of the restaurant (it's a really large/deep space), and we were surrounded by wall-mounted TV's, all broadcasting different shows (some news, some sports, some entertainment). Personally, I found it quite distracting. Overkill. Perhaps that's just me.\n\nAgain we were impressed by the huge selection of foods on the menu.

I checked it out some of the reviews here to figure out what kind of place to expect and I got a little worried once I saw how varied the experiences were. Unfortunately it seemed like the best thing about this place was their happy hour, and we were going to miss that (uh-oh). So, I shook it off and decided that I would just have to see for myself.\n\nFirst things first: I just can't say enough about how great the staff at Caffe Boa was that night! Everyone was so friendly and helpful. Our waiter, Wally, was fantastic! His initial soliloquy about the concept of the restaurant and review of the specials was borderline overwhelming, but he was happy to answer our questions, so it all worked out. Granted, the food and drinks took quite a while to get out to us, but we were busy chatting and generally having a good time, so we didn't mind. Wally was great about checking in on us: friendly and entertaining when we needed him and totally unobtrusive when we were otherwise occupied with each other. I also love that even though our meal had ended long before we decided to leave, we weren't rushed out. What a great, relaxing place to catch up with some friends! \n\nFor our meal, we opted for the pitcher of red sangria, and were not disappointed. They didn't mind a special request to make it sans-Sambuca (black licorice in my wine? - yuk!), and overall it turned out pretty strong, with a fruity kick. We also got the grilled rustic bread appetizer (aka bruschetta). The tomatoes were beautiful! Perfectly ripe and drizzled with olive oil - so sweet and delicious, but tragically piled high atop some very burnt toast. (Sigh.) Luckily we had some more sangria to drown our sorrows. By the time the main course arrived the blackened bruschetta was but a distant memory. It was a pasta-extravaganza for all - farfalle, tortelloni, and ravioli were stuffed or mixed with organic goodness and smothered in their various sauces.  Jen raved about her rosemary chicken ravioli, but my tortelloni stuffed with sirloin and prosciuitto left a bit to be desired. Picture little chunks of hamburger wrapped in pasta. It wasn't terrible, just not worth 18 bucks. Its just too bad none of us could afford any of the other dishes on the menu, they really looked delicious. \n\nAll in all a good time and worth a trip back for happy hour.",2

I'm asking if this table cost X amount with gratuities, where did the other cost come from? Total frekin scam. On another note, music was fair. Mix of a little of everything.

I asked for the trio meal, with brisket, pork and baby back ribs, but they refused me.  They said they could add the baby backs to the duo meal for an extra $6.  Not wanting to get off the \""high\"" of quitting my job, I relented.\n\nThis time I asked for no greens and they obliged.  When the meal came, the food was cold. (It was about 7:30pm; they close at 8:30.)  I tried not to let it get me down.  The $6 baby backs amounted to exactly two (2) bones.  And I'm not even quite sure I got the baby backs, because they were meaty and chewy (and cold), resembling St. Louis ribs (which I could have gotten at a discount).  Anyway, that's not my biggest complaint.  This time, for some reason, I found the BBQ sauce to be very spicy.  I don't recall it being spicy the first time around (otherwise, I would have marked it down).  So for those of you keeping count -- I recommend the brisket and the pork but NOT the \""baby back ribs\"" -- and also, come here during lunch, when the food is presumably fresher and hotter.  Aside from that, I think I'm done here.  Not that I can afford to eat anymore, now that I'm an unemployed bum.\n\nMerry Christmas.  I'm going to kill myself.",0

If, however, you eat more than say a New York City runway model getting ready for Fashion week, then avoid attempting to eat here.\n\nThe first time I tried the Italian Restaurant (named with such apparent lack of energy it foreshadows the experience) I ordered a mozzarella and prosciutto sandwich, which was OK, but nothing fabulous. The portion was small, but not ridiculously so, and came with a small pile of plain, leafy greens tossed in olive oil. The sandwich consisted of a hard crusted bread, slice of mozzarella and paper thin slice of prosciutto - simple, plain and fairly bland.  I left unsatisfied, but not angry...\n\nNot a great first try, but I'm a fan of Italian food and so loved Spasso that occupied this location prior to the Italian Restaurant, I decided to give it another shot.  Thinking that maybe I should move to the pasta section of the one page menu, that this is where the Italian in the Restaurant would shine through, I ordered the ravioli special.  It was, simply put, underwhelming!  There were 6 (I counted) square ravioli that were no bigger than the width of a typical fork.  Looking at the meager portion I thought, wow these must be incredible - at $12 for the dish, $2 a ravioli should be amazing.  Surprisingly, and unfortunately, this was definitely not the case.

There was a lady that helped me that was completely rude, unfriendly, and did not care about what I just expressed. :( Just rude and wanting to hurry and take an order from me.

So while we were shopping in the area, we decided to check it out even though we already ate. \n\nIt's located in front of the Ross store in the shopping center near the airport. On the corner of Eastern and Oquendo. You can see the \""grand opening\"" flags from Eastern.\n\nFast casual place. Order and pay up front and seat yourself. The dining area sign says max capacity 50. There were about 2 other families dining in and I felt it was already cramped. The tables are too close together. Barely any walking space in between.  Cant imagine 50 persons in there. Place is clean though.\n\nThey serve the traditional favorites like bbq shortribs, kalua pork plate lunches with 2 scoop rice and 1 scoop mac salad. I thought it was cool I can skip the carbs and in place they include eggs. Great for those who want to boost their protein intake.\n \nTaste wise though it's between 'meh' and alright. It's missing a bit of the local 808 flavor and vibe for me.\n\nThe bbq shortribs I had wasn't the best quality. Then again the price was right for what I got. Judging by the Styrofoam boxes that I just threw out when I cleared out the fridge, safe to say that even my haole honey didn't think much of his Portuguese saugage and fried rice.  He has that dish all the time at other Hawaiian restaurants and  he cleans his plate. \n\nThe Taro smoothie was not too bad and the malasada I tried was okay. It's affordable though. It's just that I've had much better food at other places near me. \n\nStaff is nice but there was just a bit of a language barrier and ordering was a tad difficult. \n\nThe family that owns this place just opened a new Chinese restaurant next door though. Maybe I'll give that place a shot the next time I ever in the area. Cool points for having delivery service! Im just  not in no rush though for the dine in part.",0

False verbiage or failure to provide all the information is probably one of my biggest marketing pet peeves, especially since I work in this field. Just some constructive criticism to pass on: 1) update the verbiage to be more upfront about the offer 2) Honor your marketing collateral.

Waited at least 30 minutes for our food. This I didn't mind so much. Shrimp ceviche: the portion was palm-sized. Tasted good. They brought us a shrimp po boy - not popcorn shrimp - but my companion was too hangry to complain. I didn't complain because it was loud, so maybe it was an honest mistake. Anyway... The remoulade on top was very, very sweet, it was too much. The shrimp themselves were good but they got so soggy in that sauce. (I'm from the South, no sauce is that sweet.) For the portion sizes and taste, it wasn't a good value. We paid $40 including tip and came away hungry.

I post up on one of the leather couches and enjoy a glass (or three) of wine. They also have specials each night of the week so check them out! They have nights with half off apps, half off wine, etc. It's a great place to go and hang out, chat and catch up with friends. The staff seem knowledgeable and always willing to help! \n\n I've had some of the appetizers, the Mezza plate (olives/hummus/feta dip) and the Caprese salad. Both were good but I though that the Mezza plate could have come with more olives. I also had the chocolate mousse dessert and wow - it was so rich and chocolaty! Yum!! \n\nAlso - if you have any type of groupon/restaurant.com deal, know that these cannot be combined with their daily specials.",3
2063,0,"Went to Tuscan Oven for mother's day with my mom, her husband, aunt and grandmother. We had a terrific time! The food was great, fresh, hot and delicious. The service was also fantastic. We started off with the stuffed gnocchi's, YUM. Then caesar salad and I had the homemade fettucine pasta with alfredo, chicken and broccoli. The pasta was cooked perfectly and everything was delicious! Mom had the meatloaf, grandma had the shrimp scampi and my aunt had the rockfish. Everyone loved their food. Tasted very fresh! We love eating outside of chain restaraunts and really enjoyed the service and food we had today. We even stayed awhile after and were never rushed out. We really enjoyed our entire experience and look forward to eating there again!",3
2064,0,"I wanted to love PastaBAR, as I love all of it's selling points (downtown, late night, fresh local ingedients, small plates).  But I didn't.\n\nIn a word: underwhelming.  The portions are elegant.  The prices would be perfectly fair if the food rocked.  But everything seemed underseasoned, stark and lacked depth of flavor.  There is simple food, which I dig, but this seemed austere.\n\nI will go back and sample other dishes: I need this place!",0
2065,0,"Yelp's average of 3.5 is how I feel about this place.  Another smoked meat place, but they're open 24 hours!!!!  Awesome.  If you needed a place to eat in the middle of the night... this is the place I'd go.  \n\n I actually had the smoke meat fried rice.  Random I know... but that's just what called out to me at 4am in the morning.  Lots and lots of flavor in this particular dish.   Typically, the ingredients in fried rice don't have this overwhelming amount of flavor.  But with those smoked meats, it makes this dish super intense with flavors.  (maybe too much?)   it's garnished with cubes of tomatoes which I actually really wish they added more of.  The tomatoes helped sweeten each bite of the fried rice.  Also tried the chicken noodle soup, it was \""okay\"".  Noodles were kinda thin and clumped all together. \n\nThe initial service was  SUPER ... but they were VERY very busy.  I can kinda forgive them for that.  As the meal progressed, they were a lot more attentive.",4

Especially since I am not much help with in the random knowledge department. I'll still make my presence known with a few drinks though. \n\nThe food is typical greasy bar food. The nachos are lackluster. The Juicy Lucy and the Rueben are rather delicious though. Most of the items that come out of the fryer has a pool of oil on the bottom of the plate.

2073,0,"I went to Gelato 64 because I was looking for a place to go for dessert after a charity event in Gilbert, and this place was the only gelato shop nearby that was open until 11pm on a Friday.  The people working here were cool and let my friends and I sample as many flavors as we wanted (and there were a lot) before we made our decisions.  The gelato selections are great and varied with flavors like mascarpone, peanut butter, coconut, and some tropical mix of guava, mango, and papaya, I think.  I ended up getting the blueberry, and it was really good!  I can't say that Gelato 64 was AWESOME, but I can't say that it sucked, either.  It's just your standard gelato shop (with maybe more flavors) that does the job of satisfying your craving.  The prices are fine, parking is not a problem, and the people working there are your standard employees who are just working to work and not really cuz they have a passion for gelato.  So...overall, I may or may not go back at some point in the future, but it's not like I'm rushing to get back there.  I'm also not crossing it off my list of places to boycott.  Gelato 64 is just fine.  \n\nPS: When I went, the smell of Lysol or whatever cleaning product they were using was really overwhelming, and my friends and I couldn't wait to pay and get outside, but I'm not really counting that as a negative per se.  At least I know that they're cleaning.  Just wanted to give you all a heads up.",2
2074,0,"5 stars for the food! 3 stars for everything else.. This will be the spot I take all my out-of-towners if they are craving some Thai food!\n\nI had some family that were visiting and they were in the mood for some quality grubbing. After doing a quick search on the yelp, I was intrigued by this spot. Following the recommendations of the yelp squad, we quickly made our way over here from the hotel where they were staying.\n\nWhen we arrived here, there was a short 10 minute wait. The atmosphere is very quaint. The first thing I noticed as we were escorted to our booth was that the seats are in desperate state of disrepair. I literally sunk half a foot into them. We received our cool engraved menus and proceeded to order. The suggestions from previous yelp reviews were imbedded into our minds, and helped us tremendously. \n\nFood wise, it was probably some of the best Thai, ever. And I truly mean that. The spice level that we asked for in each dish was exactly on point, something that has never happened to me except at LoS. That says a lot.\n\nHerbal Salad - believe the hype, for it is real. This is a *must order* item! I don't know if this their signature dish, but it should be. It's a very unassuming plate.. but aren't a lot of great dishes the same way? After taking in that first spoon, it was love at first bite. The textures were amazing. Apples, crunchy tofu, lemongrass, and much, much more. I'll leave it to you guys who've never tried it, to experience it for yourselves. You won't regret it.\n\nDrunken noodles - they killed it here as well. I was mystified how they were able to add all that flavor into each rice noodle. It's pretty crazy. It was as if the sauce and spices were made into the noodles. A stunner!\n\nMango sticky rice - the mango was perfectly ripe, and tasted how a real mango should taste like. The sticky rice was sticky-icky! It also wasn't cloyingly sweet, and complimented the mango brilliantly. Another winner!\n\nThe panang curry and tom yum soup were excellent and items that I would highly recommend!\n\nBut, like in many operations, service kind of destroyed a great meal. Our server was gracious, kind, and helpful. But asking two servers to run a full restaurant, taking orders, running their food, and bussing their tables is just asinine. I know that the business is trying to cut costs, but as the great Chris Carter says \""C'mon, man!\""\n\nService aside, I would happily come back here because the food is that good. I shall see you on that flip side!",3

2076,0,Only mediocre compared to Texas de Brazil. It fell very short on the atmosphere and the salad bar. Slightly short on the meats. Couldn't believe we were seated with no reservation so easily....now I know. Service was overzealous!! (I guess that's better than inattentive).,2
2077,0,"I ordered a noodle bowl and some breaded shrimp. The bowl was small and barely had noodles. The breaded shrimp was dry, hard, and tasteless. This place was a waste of money and I left hungry. The food is better next door at the 808 sushi place or at Hawaiian Flavor.",0
2078,0,"I had high hopes for this place.  It had some great reviews here and at other places.  Also, I bought a groupon for it a while ago.  So, my husband and I decided on this place for our date night last night.  The shuttle from the valet parking lot was interesting, not necessary, but a nice touch.\nWe were able to immediately order our drinks upon sitting, but while he was shortly provided with his soda, I waited ten plus minutes for my mojito.  It was mighty tasty, tho!\nWe ordered the skirt steak skewers.  There were three for $12.  While we enjoyed them, there was just not a lot of them.  Since I was starting to worry that this might be one of those places where my husband leaves hungry, I let him have two of the skewers.\nI had the pork tenderloin with mexican rosotto and my husband had the chicken enchiladas.  My food was so fantastic that I didn't offer to share except for the rosotto.  My husband ate all of his enchiladas and didn't want my rosotto.  Since I decided to take half of my food home, we decided we could \""share\"" a dessert.  (Meaning I had three bits)  We had banana and something empanadas.\nThe food was really delicious, but minus my two mojitos, our bill was still over $70.  I just don't think it was $70 good.  \nI would consider trying it for lunch, since I work downtown.  I just don't think I would return for dinner, hence the 3 stars.",1
2079,0,"I went here on recommendation from a friend.  I saw the reviews it had already picked up and figured it couldn't be too bad.  Well, its not too good either.  My first issue is that they don't offer Egg Beaters as a substitute.  Not a big deal, but I had assumed a trendy place and trendy spot might.  Next, the potatoes that were served to me were absolutely from the day before.  We have all had leftover potatoes and know the difference.  Finally, the restrooms and the soap \""squeeze\"" bottle were incredibly filthy.  \n\nUnless you simply can not make scrambled eggs on your own, avoid the hype of this place.",0

So, when my husband and I had a chance to get away for a meal, I naturally chose Salty Sow.  I wish that I could talk about the wonderful dishes that I had, but they were all only okay.  I had the candied pork belly.  I guess in my head I pictures something somewhat crispy.  I was very wrong.  It's a braised dish.  It's not a bad dish, just not something I would convince me to come back again.\n\nMy husband had the lamb burger and I had to sample.  It was pretty good if you enjoy tapenade. It's not really for me.  \n\nService was good up until we asked for the check.  It felt like a lifetime before it finally arrived, and then it was wrong.\n\nOverall, it was an okay experience.",0
2081,0,It's not as good as you hope. It's not a real pub. And the food is less than mediocre. I guess the real reason to stop in is for the beer.

We were happy that we were seated in one of the off shoot rooms from the front area, much much less noisy.

The Martini, came forgot the olives and there was a lime wedge with the Martini, wrong, sent it back and was redone and all was well.\n\nWe started off with appetizers of Tuna Poke and a Signature Roll, both very good. For entrees we had: Braised Short Ribs of Beef, Seared Sea Scallops, Blackened Island Ahi, and Tempura California White Sea Bass.\n\nAll were perfectly cooked and very good. I can't say anything bad, but for the prices, Roy's still had that \""Chain Restaurant\"" aura about it. Can't put my finger on it, maybe the decor, the amount of tables, the scent or the lighting?

2083,0,"I wanted to like this place and I hate writing bad reviews for local establishments. I work a couple of blocks away at university of phoenix and thinking this place is the same as the az bread company that comes to the downtown farmer's market I recommended this place to everyone. I had never been here but figured it had the same quality. it does not.\n\nI come for coffee sometimes and first of all if you are going to do specialty coffees and compete with dutch brothers and starbucks learn to do it right. I don't mind spending 3-6 bucks on coffee depending on what I get but it for sure needs to be good. I got a couple of their frozen drinks during the summer. They have little coffee in them. When I asked for an extra shot I was informed it is $2 a shot. Um again dutch brothers on rural and guadalupe. Go there instead and it's $0.50. Now back to the coffee experience. I went again today thinking how bad of an experience can a basic iced coffee be? It's about $2/60 for an ice coffee so not that badly priced, flavor is extra. I asked for a large. They don't do large except in hot coffee. So if you want iced, which is plain coffee dilluted with ice and water you can only get a 10oz coffee. Excuse me???? I asked for pumpkin flavor and either they charged me and only put in half pump or never put it in at all. I asked about it and the lady says 'oh well you wouldn't be able to see the flavor.\"" mmmmk but in a quality establishment I should be able to taste it right?? I call foul here. Terrible place for coffee.\n\nOk so now onto the food...\n\nThe sandwiches are lackluster. My friend got a grilled cheese and a drink which was almost $10. The grilled cheese was soft and not grilled at all. Do we see a problem here? My bagel was grocery store quality. Another co-worker reported getting an iceberg salad. I just don't understand how this place survives with so many good places in this area. \n\nIf you want coffee go to dutch brothers. If you want baked goods go to the croissant place down the street, and if you want a good basic sandwich go to the safeway a little further down. But skip this overpriced 'bakery'",0

On the way up I was approached by two individuals by the elevator. The elevator was in a location isolated from the common areas. The woman made me very nervous.

The nutella was prominent and it was plain addictive. Pretty huge for one person, best to share since nutella is quite sweet\nStrawberry Banana Shake - pretty darn tasty, surprisingly light for a shake and not overly sweet\nCookie dough Shake - Not my favourite, had chunks of cookie dough with most of it blended in. Just like a light chocolate doughy shake\n\nLamb Burger - Well seasoned, a little gamey with a nice kick from the spices. Not bad but not my favourite.\nSalmon Burger - Amazing. The salmon fillet came looking like a patty (round) which was a tad alarming BUT it was just cut that way. Fresh and cooked a little rare in the middle, which was fine for us.

The food - it's average and overpriced for what it is. I quite simply expected better. \n\nI started with the Two plus Two, an heirloom and cherry tomato salad with mozzarella and burrata. It was tasty, but big for an appetizer, my plate came with 3 massive balls of cheese on it, a heart attack on a plate! My date had an ahi and hamachi tartare, which was bland. \n\nI had the King Crab Legs for a main and my hubbie had combo with filet mignon and lobster. We ordered the trio of mash and creamed spinach on the side as the server had recommended 2 sides for 2 people. He must have been upselling as we couldn't even eat one between the 2 of us. \n\nThe mains were the better part of the dinner, the crab portion was massive, but really hard to eat. It was served without a shellfish fork or any other tool to get the meat out. It was partially cracked, but not enough to be of use. I also had to ask the server for a wet towel as no finger bowl was brought to the table. The steak, according to hubby was good. The part that was disturbing was the amount of butter in everything, it made it too rich to eat. The potato tasted overwhelmingly of butter, the spinach was a grease slick and we both had butter sauces served with our meal. \n\nThe main reason why Rare 120 got 2 stars rather than 3 is the service. Our server was unbelievably bad. \n\n1.We were drinking glasses of no doubt expensive bottled water, and the server came and topped up our glasses with tap water. \n\n2. When I said something about the water, he came back with a new bottle but left us the glasses still filled with the tap water mix, uh, are we supposed to pass it back and forth between the 2 of us and drink it from the bottle? \n\n3. When I asked for glasses, he brought us scorching hot glasses. Dude it's a no brainer, change them on the empty table behind you! \n\n4. We had to ask for pretty much everything that should have been automatic - the water, new napkins, cutlery, drinks, a plate to put all the seafood shells on, something to clean our hands with. It's like the server had never eaten out before and had no idea what people would expect.\n\nCan't say I'll ever give this place a second chance, it's not worth the hundreds of dollars you'll end up spending.

2103,0,"This is a pretty firm hotel and the rooms are legit.  Some people have yelped about the lack of flat panel tvs in the room but I didn't have a problem with that.   The bathrooms were terrific, the water pressure is very strong and there is nice detail throughout - such as the marble tile.  The only downside to the hotel is the pool, which although attractively landscaped, doesn't have much going for it.  There are really only two pools to use, and they are both rather unspectacular rectangular lap type pools.  The other two pools have big fountains in the middle that make those pools mostly decorative.  The servers rarely come around and take your order poolside.  I was there this past weekend, at the pool on Sat and Sun, and no one came by to take my order.  Fuck, I can stay somewhere cheaper like the RIO and a hot girl is going to come around frequently and ask if I want a drink.  I get that this pool is \""classy\"" but without regular bar service, I might as well be at a country club - not in Las Vegas.  Also, music poolside was horrendous.  It was a continuous mix of soft rock and shitty balads.   I don't want to hear Barry fucking Manilow in the middle of a Saturday in Las Vegas.   I'm in my late 30's but I'm not in adult diapers yet so please, music recorded in the last ten years as a mimimum.  In terms of \""babes\"" at the pool, not so good.  I'm talking hotel guests.  Mostly older cougars and if you're a woman, good luck.  Lots of fat dudes and straight up losers.  Some bros but obviously they are probably at pools with attractive girls.  A decent selection of hot girls were to be found, but no doubt, they were looking for \""clients\"" not a tan.  So if you can get past the retirement community vibe of the pool, this is a great place to stay.",0

Even though Dan was still working on other phones, rather than turning me away, he said he could get mine done that day and stayed open past 5. There was a hard plastic band around the edge of my phone that was also cracked. Dan offered to replace it, free of charge, if he could take it from another phone. Unfortunately, that piece was more damaged on the phones he had, but it was awesome of him to offer!",3
2105,0,"Okay so I totally get why this place is so popular, its cheap, fast and mostly easy aside form the long waits. We've never waited before as we use opentable for a reservations which takes away the hassle of standing around outside and being hounded by panhandlers. Anyways.. service is pretty tight and the dishes come out really fast so if you're looking to relax while you're dining you'll need to let your server know that you are in no rush. \n\nWhile perusing the menu we ordered a whole pitcher of their tasty sangria, a must. If you don't like wine they also have a full bar though their beer selection kind of sucks all the same bottles everyone else serves. Very disappointing. \n\nThe menu is pretty huge with a little something for everyone. Our server recommended 2-4 plates per person though we totally over ordered, 4 plates each was a little to much for the 3 of us. Below is the laundry list of dishes we order along with quick comments. \n\n+Tomato bread is chewy bread topped with tomatoes though the juice of the tomato along with salt and vinegar has soaked into the bread making it really moist and flavorful. Loved it.\n\n-Artichoke toasts.. to be honest I don't even really remember eating these. I guess that would mean they were just alright. \n\n+Sausage plate was one of my favorites. Thin slices of various cured Spanish sausages along with mustard, pickles, olives etc.. \n\n+Tuna tartare was huge and for the price a great value. Super fresh tasting with a light seasoning just enough to enhance the flavor of the fish. Winner winner!  \nStuffed dates are addictive and their bacon wrapped version packs a whole lot flavor into one tiny bite.\n\n-Baked tetilla was alright, melted cheese really. There are better things to order.\n\n+Manchego Mac n cheese was pretty good. Nice and gooey with a decent crust. \n\n-Thai beef salad was the weakest dish. I'd say its more like Thai light as there really wasn't a whole lot of flavor from the beef or the dressing. I wouldn't order this salad again.\n\n+Pulpo asado, grilled octopus, was slightly chewy but had a decent amount of flavor. \n\n-Chicken and chorizo stuff mushrooms were insanely hot temperature wise, be warned. I thought they were just okay but probably wouldn't order these again either. \n\n-Ham and cheese croquetas had a good texture but not as tasty as one might imagine.  They needed dipping sauce.\n\n+Filet mignon sliders were pretty good though I wished that they came out hotter. \n\n+Baby back ribs were pretty awesome, sticky, porky meaty and satisfying. \n\nSo over all a good time with lots of tasty bites. Definitely great for either a light meal or like we had, a serious tapas feast. Be sure to make your reservations ahead of time!",2

Big selection of produce, meat, dairy, you name it - except garbanzo bean ... I don't know why my friend and I couldn't find it that night. We weren't even drunk. The prices of goods are cheap, too. I bought almost lifetime supply of paper towel for only $6.99. Yeay.\n\nAside from Woodman's huge selection on everything and prices being very cheap, I don't have too much to say. Oh wait!

2113,0,"I am a huge fan of this place.  Our group had a conference at the JW Marriott Desert Ridge and all of the staff (that's me!) stayed at the Residence Inn.  We were the first group to stay in the hotel.  Where do I start?  I kinda feel like I'm about to write a report for school, so here goes:\n\nWhy I love the Residence Inn Desert View\nBy Andrea H.\n\n1)  The staff.  Everyday when we came back from work, it was like coming home.  Kind of like seeing your family after a long day.  They all got to know us so we felt like friends.\n2)  The rooms.  My room was so cozy, I felt like I was in my own apartment (well kind of).  I loved the swivel flat screen tv that could go from bedroom to living room in a turn.  They have free wifi and wired internet and I could actually bring leftovers home and put them in my fridge.  You can also buy frozen dinners, etc. at the front desk and microwave them in your room.  And the best part, free microwave popcorn replenished daily.\n3)  Free shuttle service within 5 miles.  I swear, the poor shuttle guy never saw the outside of his van, but he was really great about driving our rowdy group all over the place.\n4)  The pool/BBQ area.  I didn't swim, but the pool is really nice, with cabanas and a BBQ area.  We christened the grill with some burgers & dogs and hung out by the fire pits with some cold beers. Awesome.\n5)  Breakfast included.  A full hot breakfast is served every morning and it is goooood.  Lots of options.  I think they do happy hour some nights too, but that was still in the works when we were there.\n6)  Fitness room.  I wasn't expecting much from a \""fitness room\"", but it wasn't the old rusty rowing machine and bike that I was expecting.  They have several machines with tv screens on them and some free weights.  It's not Equinox, but pretty nice for a Residence Inn.\n7)  Location (well, relatively speaking).  If you're around for business, there are lots of places to eat nearby at the Desert Ridge Mall and City North.  There are also two movie theaters.  It's about a 20 minute walk,   which isn't too bad.  The shuttle stops at 9, but we refused to pay an $8 cab to take us a mile.  It was kind of a nice stroll, although my friend was convinced the javelinas were going to get us.  The shuttle driver told us not to worry, they are blind and if they come running, we should just step aside and watch them run by.  Yeah.  I'll keep that in mind.\n\nAs with any new hotel, they have a few kinks to work out, but I'm willing to overlook them since they opened early for us and whenever something went wrong, they were literally there in 1 minute.  Since I basically live in hotels, it is nice to have the opportunity to stay at a place like this.",4
2114,0,"I went to Femme Fest at the Visulite and saw some great female performers. I really like the Visulite - with its cool but cozy interior. The only downside is that the floor is pretty tiny. I've stayed on the level just above the floor every time I've been there and ended up sitting at a table (and I'm normally a stand-right-by-the-stage concert-goer).\n\nI've also been impressed with the service at the bar each time I've gone.

Unfortunately there were plenty of problems including really bad service and the staff not being alerted that we were coming.

I will go back but never to do anything but sit at the bar with no more than one or two other people.",3
2120,0,"I had a pretty good time at this place soon after it opened.  The music was really good.\n\nCut to a year later- I spent 6 months planning my sister's bachelorette party in Vegas.  We went all out.  I decided on Tryst for our last night in Vegas and called a month ahead to reserve a table.  The manager said \""no problem\"" and took my name.  This was the first time I reserved a table at a bar and didn't have to put down a credit card- weird.  Well, I found out why we didn't need a credit card, when 8 of us arrived we passed up the line and were told at the door that they didn't have our reservation.  I called the idiot I booked with and he finally returned my call an hour later mumbling about being sorry.  No \""sorry\"" would ever make up for that, I had 8 girls wondering what the hell was going on, plus the night was ruined for my sister- which I can't stand to think about.  I can't redo a bachelorette party\n\nThere are a lot of nightclubs to choose from in Vegas!  I trusted this place to take care of us, we got f**ked. \n\nNow I am planning my cousins big birthday weekend.  Do you think I will suggest Tryst?",0

The waitress had to have walked by my empty glass (that was conveniently sitting on the edge of the table) at least 10 times, I had to wave her down to get a refill; I don't know if she would have ever asked if I wanted more. Also, I asked for a non-spicy version of one of their chef's special rolls and the waitress suggested I try another roll, I agreed and instead of getting just the suggestrd roll she also ordered me the original roll(spicy). I ordered edamame, that never came... we asked for the check and the waitress asked if we would like dessert or a sliced orange, asked for the Orange, the check came... the orange was missing...Very disappointed as they are one of the few places with fresh sushi in town.",0
2125,0,"From my initial phone call to find out the procedure to have my Baby repaired, I was extremely impressed. You see my \""Baby\"" was struck from behind by a sweet elderly woman who was happy to accept fault by having her insurance fix it.  \n\nBeing new to the Las Vegas, I began my search for reputible auto body shops on Yelp.  My search turned up four shops in my very immediate area, so i figured this should be easy  When I called other competitors, they were dry, rushed, or robotic.  I setup appointments at three other places. One was nice, but overcharging for repairs. The next place was unstructured and had me there 25 minutes past my appointment before they looked at my vehicle, and rudely handed me the estimate without asking for my business.  I was starting to get discouraged and frustrated.  I refused to take my car anywhere that would not be inviting because I ask a great deal of questions. However, when I called Service King, an angelic voice answered, explained the process fully, and even reassured me that they were willing to take care of me right away, no appointment necessary!\n \nUpon arriving the receptionist/assistant, Nancy, greeted me with the same friendly smile in person that she had in her voice over the phone. She introduced me to David Biggs, who was equally as welcoming and professional. In minutes, he had my damage assessed,  estimated, and sent to my insurance liaison by 8am the next morning.  It's always the small things that matter to me. I asked David if he could install a pair of new reverse lights bulbs that I had been unable to do myself, and he assured me that he would have the pros in the shop do it, and would be happy to bill separately. \n\nOnce I received the call from State Farm, I dropped my car off for repair.  If you have  a need and coverage for a rental car, be sure to tell your insurance company to use Hertz. That way you can take advantage of Kimberly's great customer service...right next door! \n\nKeep in mind though, my mind was blown from the world class service and convenience, but I didn't expect a call a few days later from David with a progress report and a promised completion date.  So my pick up day came, Very quickly I might add, and I could not have been more satisfied. My car was repaired perfectly and cleaned inside out. And remember those reverse lamps? Well David told me it was on the house, no charge! Please do not hesitate to take your \""Baby\"" here. In my estimation, no one else comes close.",3
2127,0,"I went to this location for a dinner with my girlfriend and her parents for the father's day celebrations. This location is pretty busy, so I would highly recommend that you reserve a table ahead of time, otherwise you might end up waiting for 30 minutes. \n\nAfter we were seated, the waiter came over to take the order. I ordered the steak and crab cake, with asparagus and mashed potatoes. My gf and her parents ordered salmon and sea bass. While we were waiting for our dinner we got their complimentary bread with olive oil and pesto dip. It was a great pseudo appetizer to meal that we were about to have. Approximately, 20 minutes later the dinner arrived. The steak and crab cake came with a lobster bisque sauce. The steak was good, however it wasn't perfect, it wasn't seasoned enough and the crab with lobster bisque sauce was bit to salty. Asparagus looked like it was heavily drenched in steroids; this thing had bigger muscles than me (Got to love genetically modified vegetables).  I tried my gf's salmon and it was pretty good. Seasoned properly with delicious lemon butter sauce. \n\nOverall (3/5), good for chain restaurant, but you can do way better when it comes to seafood at other locations in LV.",0

2129,0,"This was a tough review for me.  I wanted to give them higher marks, really I did.\n\nI went in with low expectations.  I've had Jewish food on the east coast, OK?  Things were looking good right off the bat.  We were seated and water and a tray of pickles appeared as our tushes hit the cushions.  My lovely wife picked up a pickle, crunched off a bite, gave a surprised expression and said, \""Not bad.  I'll be the Jew-judge.\""  She is Jewish, after all.  Fair enough.  I thought the pickle was pretty good, comparable to some I've had on the east coast.\n\nThat's where things started to go awry.  It took between 5-10 minutes before anyone came over to get a drink order.  We ordered several items to share.  My wife and I shared a corned beef sandwich and fries with gravy.  The kids shared matzo ball soup, blintzes and a latka.  I ordered coffee.\n\nThe soup came first and it was very good and authentic.  Coffee?  \""Oh, right.\""  My water has been sitting empty for a bit.  The rest of the food arrived pretty quickly, and my coffee arrived.  Water?  \""Oh, right.\""\n\nThe blintzes were very good, especially the cheese.  The corned beef was good, it passed muster as authentic.  Fries?  Good.  Brown gravy?  Fine, but it had an odd flavor.  Latka?  Very good.  Water?  \""Oh, right.\""\n\n\""Can I get a refill on the coffee?\""  \""Oh, right.\""\n\nThe prices are high.  The sandwiches are available whole or 1/2.  $13.xx for a whole corned beef is a bit high, but it is big enough to share so that's a plus.  One sandwich and one order of fries was enough for 2 adults.   The fries were $4.xx  \n\nCoffee?  \""Oh, right.\""  I don't appreciate having to ask for every refill 3 times.  I would probably write it off to just one server having an off day or something. \n\nIn summary:  Good kosher-style food, a bit pricey.  It will hit the spot when I'm craving a corned beef sandwich.  The service was spotty.  So what may have been a 4 star review has been knocked all the way down to 3 stars.  \n\nCoffee?",3

Is this a legit hole-in-the wall find? \n\nI'm not quite sure. I had Mussman Curry with shrimp. I ordered it medium but would go hotter next time. The sauce was nice and flavorful and there were no remnants of curry flakes I have seen at other Thai places. It included shrimp, potatoes, carrots, onions and peanuts. The veggies were fine although some of them had a crinkle cut which I found oddly distracting in Thai food. The shrimp was good but a little chewy. Could be slightly overcooked or could be thawed too quickly: 2 methods with the same result, chewy shrimp. \n\nI also ordered Thai iced coffee. The server brought out Thai iced tea which I immediately started on. He quickly realized his mistake and brought out the iced coffee. I drank most of both and I actually preferred the Thai iced tea. It had a good earthy authenticity to it. Between the coffee and the tea my fingers are flying right now, BTW. \n\nThe total bill for this decent but not outstanding meal? $12.06.

The Venetian is a little easier to navigate and avoid the Casino floor.  \n\nMy room was in the Venzia Tower.  Amazing pool area.  Very nice to relax, catch some sun and avoid the business of the Strip.  Leaving the hotel and getting to the Strip is much easier than the Palazzo.

2141,0,"I recommend Sonoma Grille without reservation.  I have, as of this review, eaten lunch there three times, and each time the food has been amazing, the prices have been extremely reasonable, the portions have been just right, the meals have come out fresh and staggeringly quickly, and the wait staff has been friendly and knowledgeable.  The decor is gorgeous, the tables are neither too close to nor too far from one another (there's plenty of seating away from the bar), and it really is, TARDIS-like, bigger on the inside.  \n\nNow, normally, I like to recommend particular dishes.  I'll do that here, but understand that the Sonoma Grille menu changes with some frequency (it has done so once since the first time I ate there about six weeks ago).  If these things are still on the menu, I recommend the Pittsburgh Chopped Salad (so named, I believe, because of the crispy shoestring potatoes on top of it), the Amish Chicken Breast with fetuccine, the panko fried shrimp appetizer (which is what popcorn shrimp wants to be when it grows up - crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and spiced to perfection), and the sweet & spicy salad.  You can add a protein to any of the salads - for the PGH salad, I added salmon, and for the sweet & spicy one, I added chicken breast.  \n\nEvery time I've eaten there, I've been blown away.

(see above.)\n\nBeing a girl from the southwest, I have had a great fajita or two in my day. If you are feeling rebellious and decide to go despite the many poor reviews, know this: Mexican food is great, and this is nowhere near that.",0
2143,0,"Food was tasty. Service was SLOW.\n\nI have been back twice since this dinner, and my two-star review stands.  The food is no doubt good.  However the wait time is extremely lacking and will make me consider other establishment in the future.",0
2144,0,The sandwiches taste fine but the servings are small and the menu is really lacking variety.,2
2145,0,"I've only been here once and I like to give places a couple tries if I'm left uncertain. From my experience the food was \""OK\"". Nothing to rave about, nothing memorable. The ambiance is cool and hip. It was kind of dead for a Las Vegas restaurant but then again it was a Monday night. I'd give it a 2nd shot if I didnt have to pay for dinner.",3
2146,0,"Ordered the Roasted Veggie and the One Veggie. Both were pretty good although the crust was a bit over baked and a little too thick. The garlic knots are nothing to rave about, but the House Chips I really liked--smoky with a slight kick. Good alternative to Dominos, so we'll be back for sure.",2
2147,0,fast and friendly good food.,2
2148,0,"We went to this place as usual and were surprised to see a \""shrunken\"" happy hour menu. We ordered calamari and lobster tacos and were unhappy with these orders. They had no taste and were overlooked. It seems to us the quality of this place is going down!! Sad for that given the fact we are regulars!!!",2

2151,0,"nice room, very inexpensive, cute birds in the garden.\n\nPool crew was a drag,  No where is it written that you must bring picture id AND your room key to get in.  Long trip back to room to get ID.  Next day, the service at the pool being slow, we brought our IDs and bought a fruit salad at their restaurant right in front of the entrance to the pool...and were told we couldn't bring it in. \n\nSwimming pool was extremely crowded.  They seemed to be catering to the spring-break crowd, even in summer.  Constant announcements for \""booty shaking contests,\"" \""bikini bull riding contests\"" and sales on buckets o' beer.  If getting drunk is a vacation destination for you, this is the place to be.",0
2152,0,"If you happen to be in the Town Square location you should definitely stop by. It's located on the 2nd floor across from the movie theater parallel to Blue Martini. Customer service is ehh, but you're there for the food, not the conversation. All the seating is made up of stools facing the window. That's good cuz you really don't have to worry when you get the food all over your face and hands. Each time has been a good experience so far with 2 visits under the belt, each time visiting with my brother. Each time we ordered a fatty Olympian consisting of grilled corned beef, turkey, pastrami, onions, peppers & Swiss, plus coleslaw, 1000 island & tomato. From my stomach's perspective they are liking this sub shop. Overall it's a nice place to grab a quick bite while doing some shopping at this outdoor mall.",2

The place is clean and has plenty of large machines that can accomodate your biggest laundry needs.  The employees are friendly and will help you if you are unsure of where to start. They also have a change machine in-house which makes things easier.  \n\nAlso, if you are the lazy sort and don't want to do your own laundry, they have a drop off service where the employees will wash, dry and fold your clothes for you. Wow, who would have thought that you could still get full-service at the laundromat? \n:-)",3
2157,0,This place is an Arizona treasure.  I have been going there for 15 years now and it's always consistently good.  I recommend the 7Q & 9Q with black beans and jerk fried rice.  The included Snicker Doodle cookie makes it a complete meal.,4
2158,0,"I have previously reviewed Eggspectation and found its kitchen creations excellent. They appear to have improved their service significantly since I last shared my opinions. As promised, therefore, four stars well-deserved. \n\nThe menu has been revamped and the quirkiness and puns are mostly gone, but the eggs surely aren't. I think I will miss the great variety of dishes one could select from, however they seem to focus on a core set of competences these days and churn out a very pleasant palette of flavors.\n\nWith the sad departure of a couple of my brunch haunts, my trekking over a kilometre to Eggspectation shows it's good, filling and pleasant.",4

Thank you, Main Deli Steak House, a la prochaine.",3
2160,0,"Great craft cocktails, featuring a lot of bourbon.  Drink service is medium-slow, but that's mostly because they spend a lot of time getting drinks right instead of slinging bad drinks quickly.\n\nThe door and windows are covered over; you have to look for it.  That has an enormous benefit; it's intentionally only visited by people who specifically went there, and the hordes of roving drunks in the Southside miss this place entirely.  They seem to be sacking short-term popularity... for long term lasting power as a terrific little bar.",4
2161,0,"I came here for lunch with some coworkers. The service was good, as my drink was always refilled timely. The chips and salsa likewise. However, the salsa was a bit bland. It lacked flavor and heat. For my meal, I ordered the tamales (one beef and one pork). It came with a side of rice and beans, which is standard for any sit down Mexican restaurant. The tamales were extra cheesy on top. A definite plus in my book. The meats were tender and delicious. The portion size was ample. Overall, a solid restaurant.",3

2164,0,"My boyfriend and I went here on veterans day (when apparently they were quite busy) and were told it would be a five minute wait for two massage ladies for us.\nOne arrived about 10 minutes before the other so she started on me first. We understood they were busy but would have appreciated them telling us how long it was going to be rather than saying \""5 minutes\"" when it definitely was longer than that. They had to call two girls in from another shop.\nThe girl working on me was incredibly sweet but unfortunately she didn't know what she was doing :( Most of the time it just HURT.. \nThe staff was very attentive and tried to make sure we had drinks or whatever we needed.\nThe TV was on the entire time which to me seemed a bit inappropriate in a massage place.\nThe room is open, with only curtains separating the massage chairs, so whenever someone walks in for a massage it disrupts the entire relaxation thing. Not nice. \nOverall I wasn't very impressed. And given how many foot massage places are in the area, I probably won't be back to this one.",0
2165,0,"Ok let's just start by saying we love Oreganos. And we were so happy that one opened up on the \""west side\"". First off there are a whopping 4 seats at the bar.  What??!!  Then the hostess tried her hardest to turn away our business stating that the wait was 90 minutes and that the \"" bar is full\"" so do you still want to put your name in?  We proceeded into the bar for a drink and the bartender was less that happy to serve us also!!  There were several tables wide open so we were confused about the 90 minute wait?  Then a waitress came to get us within 20 minutes not 90!  I will say that once we were seated our waitress was good and so our evening was salvaged.  However, we will probably drive to Paradise Mall location for a better experience.",0
2168,0,"No. I love American Chinese food, but it can be good or it can be very bad. This was very bad. My general tso was absolutely drenched in sauce---bright, vibrant red. This would be okay, but it didn't taste like anything, and the chicken was not high quality--nubbly. The batter was soft. The egg rolls were meh. The ragoons were only passable. The egg drop soup was meh. The white rice was like instant rice. I know it can't actually be instant rice; that would be too expensive. But it was just like that for taste and texture. My wife's kung pao was also very bland, brown sauce out of a can without many peanuts or any taste.\n\nI don't get understand the positive reviews. This was, all in all, pretty disgusting, even for someone who kind of likes bad food. The people who work there were super nice---maybe that's why all the good reviews?",0
2169,0,Just cruising through the shops at Mandalay Bay. We decided to grab some grub at this place. We came during the happy hour and were glad we did. The chips and salsa were good. We had the plate of pork nachos and the grilled corn. I loved the mayo butter they grilled on the corn. I would definitely suggest  that as an appetizer. And gotta love buy one get one free margarita happy hour. I enjoyed my experience and will come back.,3
2170,0,My husband and I ate here with his parents Saturday.  We arrived at 5:45 for a 6:00 dinner reservation.  The restaurant was half empty when we placed our order.  It took 55 minutes and two requests to our waitress to get our first course.  It took another 30 for our main.  I complained to the waitress and the general manager.  Both were unapologetic stating there was nothing they could do as it was the first night of restaurant week.  Restaurant week means a trimmed down menu and I assume is meant to attract new customers.  There are too many other great restaurants in the area to give Cowboy Ciao a second chance with such an unapologetic attitude.,0
2171,0,"when you don't have much time in between flights, mexican is usually the way to go. sure you when you think of beans & a plane ride, they don't conjure an ideal situation. though overall it usually works out. i had the chimichanga though asked that it not be fried... basically i wanted a burrito with everything in it without paying money for each item added on as extra. i found the meat to be really dry... actually overall it wasn't that appetizing. i think if they had put salsa or some refreshing or flavorful sort of taste into their burrito, it would definitely save it. it was bland. that's all that comes to mind. it was definitely worth the \""meh\"". \n\nthough as i mentioned before when you have to eat quick on the go you don't have time to think & ask if they can change things. so in the end... don't order it unless you have overactive salivary glands that help make this meal juicier.",0
2172,0,Seattles Best is a nice cup of coffee at a fair price. I like that they have Odwalla and other juices for rare moments when I'm not feeling a cafe or espresso in the morning. The coffee is a nice cup and most of the flavored lattes are usually pretty good. Nothing great but good. There are better coffee shops in town but since I come to South Point to bet and play it serves it purpose and is consistent every time. It is nice that it is right in the  front entrance for valet or when parking in the front lot or near the sports book.,3
2173,0,"Was quoted 3-4 weeks...but it was actually SIX weeks. To top it off, the work was done poorly.\nSo after an additional 2 weeks, I get the call that it was redone. Problem was, now there are scratches on my gun.. When I point this out, I'm met with complete indifference. They could care less that a customer is unhappy. They actually told me to 'live with\"" the horrible outcome.\n\nI would give this company ZERO stars, but yelp won't let me.",0
2174,0,"Great People, Great Shop. They have some of the best people in the industry working hard to make it happen and they offer better than new service. They have great accessibility and good group rides. I highly recommend them. The selection is just awesome there too. Parking isn't all that bad either. Check 'em out!",3
2175,0,"After being at the Peppermill for the first time, I was kicking myself mentally that I hadn't been here sooner.  I enjoyed everything about it, from the large, comfortable booth with royal blue, aqua, and lavender fabric in which we sat; the immediate pouncing on us after we were seated by water carrier, cocktail waitress, and server in quick succession; the snappy, blue and white, mini-skirted uniforms of the servers; the swirling neon blue and pink tubes of light overhead and tube of red light circling around the dining room below; the immense menu; to the wonderfully tasty and generously sized food that Diane and I enjoyed on a recent Tuesday night.  And, as we entered and left the restaurant, every served dish I saw on other diners' plates looked massive, well crafted, and tasty.\n\nI began our late dinner with a bowl of Beef Barley Soup.  It contained cubed beef, barley, mushroom slices, tomato, celery, and a real tasty, oily beef broth.  The only negative is that the mushrooms appeared to be of the canned variety.  \n\nAn excellent Spinach Salad with egg, fresh spinach leaves, bacon, and a Catalina Dressing that tasted like Hot Bacon Dressing was next, followed by a BLTA packed with bacon, red tomato, lettuce, an ample smear of mayonnaise, and huge, beautifully green and yellow, cool chunks of perfectly ripe avocado on lightly toasted Sourdough Bread as I had requested.  Numerous French Fries were also on the plate, because I had forgotten to order desired Potato Salad, which was an included alternative, along with a choice of cottage cheese, onion rings, or a fruit cup.  So, just a little belatedly, I ordered and paid for a side of Potato Salad.  When it arrived in a large teardrop dish, my work in dispatching this large side, along with my jam-packed sandwich, began.  But it was easy to do, for this excellent creamy white, mayonnaise-based Dill Potato Salad with skin-on Red Potatoes and celery was simply delicious.  The Fries were good, but I enjoyed the Potato Salad more.\n\nDiane, meanwhile, raved about the 3 large and juicy Arctic Cod fillets and the incredible amount of crisp deep-fried Curly Fries that covered her platter and constituted an order of Icelandic Fish and Chips.  She also very much liked her excellent, rich Hot Chocolate with Whipped Cream.  As usual, I finished all of my meal, and Diane ate what she could, and had the rest packed for lunch at home.\n\nBut we were by no means done.  I had my eye on another Peppermill offering as soon as I read through the gargantuan menu, and Diane was game, as well.  So, to cap off a fine dinner, we ordered a Colossal Hot Fudge Sundae to share.\n\nAnd, this was some sundae.  Besides a generous supply of French Vanilla Ice Cream in a large and high elongated glass sundae dish, this treat featured mini-chocolate chips, chopped peanuts, a mountain of whipped cream, an obligatory cherry on top, and a load of warm and sweet Hot Fudge (see pic)--likely four times the amount of Hot Fudge one will find in the average Hot Fudge Sundae served elsewhere.  I asked our server how many scoops of ice cream were in our sundae, and she replied that normally 3 scoops are included but this was the first one she had ever made, and because she wanted us to be pleased with it, she had put in FIVE SCOOPS!  I highly recommend this dish--but not for just 1 person!  It was so wonderfully good that Diane and I finished it all--but just barely! \n\nThis was a great meal with very friendly and mostly great service.  Only my specially ordered Potato Salad was initially forgotten temporarily, and I had to ask once for an Iced Tea refill.  Otherwise our server checked on us several times during our meal to make sure all was well and we were not wanting for anything. \n\nWe peeked inside the Fireside Lounge before we left, and it looked like a great romantic place to have drinks with a special partner around the fire pit.\n\nA couple other pluses about the Peppermill are that it is open 24/7, and access to lot parking is easy right off Las Vegas Boulevard just in front of the restaurant.  I expect to become a regular here, and work my way through the vast and enticing menu.  \n\nEasily Five Stars!",3

I actually got a appetizer for my main entree which was the crostini with a topping picked by the chef each day... today it was a medley of marinated veggies similar looking to a tapenade.  It just had no flavor.  I did get their sonoma salad (small) and it was very tasty.  It had figs, goat cheese, croutons, tomato and a vinaigrette dressing.  Another reason for the mid range score was service... this is lunch time people and I am kind of in a hurry.  There was only one server and what seemed like the manager helping out... not enough people to handle a lunch rush.",2

I could tell that some of the food was the microwaveable kind and none of it tasted flavorful or fresh. The skin of the Har Gow and Shau Mai was practically melting and falling apart. The white rice cake dessert that I love love love, was also falling apart. It all tasted overly cooked/steamed and had no flavor. I guess if you are in Vegas and want dim sum, then this is a good option for you. As for me, I do not plan on coming back.",0

We decided to order off the regular menu and everything we got was so delicious. The burrata was great and was served on top of an eggplant puree--I hadn't burrata served like that before, but really enjoyed it. I ordered the rockfish which was great; however, the curried millet with okra that it was served with stole the show for me. I seriously could eat that every day and might have to try to recreate it at home. My husband ordered a fish that was the special for the evening. I can't remember what it was, nor did I try it (isn't this review incredibly helpful??) but he did say he loved it and ate every bit, so that can't be a bad thing ;) Peach and berry pie for dessert was great, although it was heavy on the berries and light on the peach.

2192,0,"First things first, if it wasn't for Jim (my GPS which I've named as part of the family), I would never find this airport. Mostly because I'm not familiar with the area but also because airports tend to be hidden away even though their main purpose is, in fact, for people to find them and fly away from them. Aside from that, I find this airport a little deceiving. I've been to some SMALL airports (Bangor, Maine. Moncton, New Brunswick.) and I assumed, when walking into this one, that it was small like the previous ones mentioned. So I walk through security (more like shuffle considering the traffic and security procedures), which I might add, are thorough and friendly, and I come to this whole new DIMENSION! The size of this airport is hidden until you cross security, then it's a playground (so to speak). I do like this airport a lot. I can shop (lets be serious, airport stores do have some great things), eat, lounge and board planes. The place has ALMOST everything I need! The only thing I hate about the airport (and most airports) is that the wifi isn't free. So pick up a magazine prior to arriving because you'll need it to keep occupied.

2196,0,"The BF and I have been watching a lot about Indian food lately so we're on a kick for some. I've had this bookmarked for a long time and wanted to see what the fuss is about. \n\nWhen we walked in, the owner was belting out some tunes so we just waited for her to finish to get our drinks in. I'm Filipino so I've been disenfranchised and subjected to a lot of karaoke. Some people might like the entertainment, but fair warning that if you're not keen on it, you might catch one song but not a whole performance. \n\nWe did the buffet for $10.99. I also ordered a mango lassi, good but standard. The spread was decent. With 2 chicken dishes, 6 or so veggie dishes, salad, chutneys/raita, naan,rice, spongy little cakes (dont know the name), potato pakora, rice pudding and oranges for sweets. \n\nWe both thought it was decent, but this is not our favorite lunch buffet. The standout for me was the saag which had a nice gingery flavor and creamy texture  and the refreshing rice pudding. I wish the naan wasn't premade and was fresh made as some of them were really crunchy for sitting out. The flavors were good, but I don't like that some of the items were precut bagged vegetable mix  and they were doing their supply order while we were there and it confirmed what was frozen and what was not. I know times aren't the best for businesses, but fresh vegetables is one of the reasons why I'm drawn to Indian food. \n\nI would say it was a 3.5 star buffet, I'll round up as the service was very warm, friendly and attentive and the atmosphere is nice.

2208,0,"Listen, I party. A lot.  And I don't drink and drive.  I will however, pay off an imaginary DUI by taking Uber to and from places each time I go out.  \n\nOn the evening of Halloween, my wife and I decided to party on Mill.  We knew that traffic would be terrible, as well as any overnight parking.  And worse, surge rates for Uber would be off the charts.  We both felt that getting a local hotel would be the best option.  \n\nAfter an exhaustive search, I came across the newly remodeled Graduate Tempe.  It was a bit more than the other hotels, but the location worked out well.\n\nHere is what was great about it, from start to finish:\n\n-- The website was easy to navigate.\n-- The lobby was completely redesigned and looked fantastic.\n-- The staff was friendly.  Paid attention to details, and even had a bellhop waiting to see if we needed help up to the room.\n-- The school theme was well thought out.  Even the room key cards look like old student ID's.  Hotel stationary looks like composition notebooks, and instead of hotel pens, #2 pencils.\n-- I freak out about cleanliness everywhere I go. The room was flawless.  From the bedding, to the bathroom, to the towels.\n-- All new everything! I don't mean to call out other local boutique hotels in the valley (Clarendon, El Dorado, etc.) but everything has been replaced in the rooms. Not just fresh paint, but the chairs, paintings, bedding, T.V., etc.  \n\nHere is what I would have changed:\n\n-- I didn't get a chance to really enjoy the room or the balcony.  We were there for such a short time. \n-- The same goes for trying out the newly refurbished \""Normal Diner,\"" which replaced the IHOP that had been there for years.  \n\nBoth of those things are my fault, though.\n\nIt was a fantastic looking hotel that I would love to go back to.  I usually stay at hotels based on price, and look forward to some great deals from The Graduate.\n\nEven at a regular room rate, you cannot go wrong with this hotel. Five stars for location, staff, amenities, and cleanliness.",4

2217,0,"I was visiting Phoenix for the first time and Yelped what seemed to be the best place to eat.  Lo-Lo's popped up towards the top of the list.  I've never had chicken and waffles before - I'm not a huge fan of fried chicken (waffles are OK), but wanted to try it out at least once.  This seemed like a good place to go....although I had a feeling the place was going to be overrated. \n\nWhile I don't know the Phoenix area well, the restaurant seemed to be located in the industrial boonies - the street looked a bit sketchy, and there was this ghettoish sign painted on a building pointing you to the way of Lo-Lo's.  There was plenty of street parking, and I don't recall seeing a parking lot.  It's a cute looking shop - shaped like a tiny house decorated with some neon lights.  \n\nThe place is small - I recall about 6 or 7 tables and the restaurant had most of the tables occupied on a Friday night.  Definitely not a place for big groups unless you want to take over the entire restaurant.  It's a casual spot - waiter service is casual as well.  You don't have a dedicated waiter - they have 2 or 3 people on staff to help the customers as needed (which makes sense for such a small place).\n\nI'm not quite sure why, but it took us a little while to order - there were a decent amount of items on the menu, but because the menu items were mainly combinations of the same thing, we were confused on what/how to order.  For our party of 3, we ended up ordering (I think):  Baby Ray ($13 or 12), Lo-Lo's ($12 or 11), and Stupid Fries ($8).  This place should really be a $$ rating vs. $ - our total bill including tax ended up to be a bit over $40 including tax & tip.  This was just for 2 entrees and 1 appetizer.\n\nFood came in a reasonable amount of time - probably about 10 to 15 minutes.  Portions were reasonably sized - not too big or small.  We had 5 or 6 pieces of chicken and 4 or 5 waffles to share.  The chicken was OK - I didn't find anything special about it.  Meat was tender and the crust was OK.  It helped adding some hot sauce and vinegar to help enhance the flavor.  Waffles were OK - could have been a bit better if the outside was crispier.  \n\nOverall, this place was OK - it wasn't exactly a place to rave home about.  One of the people at our table compared it to Roscoe's and said it was about the same or Roscoe's was a bit better.",2
2218,0,"I've held off writing a review of Elements simply because I've never actually eaten off the house menu. This review is based on the sheer awesomeness of how Executive Chef Beau Macmillan runs the place and the amazing opportunities that he provides. \n\nDuring the summer Elements hosts a Lunch and Learn, where they bring in top notch chefs from around the valley, as well as celebrity chefs like Robert Irvine. \n\nI attended a Lunch and Learn event hosted by Geoffrey Zakarian, judge on Chopped and all around groovy guy. Over the course of several hours he whipped up three amazing courses (with wine pairings), demonstrating how to make each dish and answering questions. the atmosphere was relaxed and fun. Chef Macmillan was also there to answer questions and make jokes as well. What an amazing day! \n\nWhile at the lunch I made reservations for another event, the Table for 12 dinner. Essentially 12 people dine in a private room that is directly off the kitchen, with only a few glass doors separating you from the chaos. the chef of the evening was Petite Maisons' own James Porter. \n\nI'm not exaggerating when I say this was the most enjoyable dining experience of my life. The setting was intimate, Chefs Macmillan and Porter were on hand to discuss the courses, food in general and any other topic came up. The passion that they feel for food really came through. \n\nThe food was amazing, the wine was perfect and the company could not be beat. Hanging out in The Jade bar afterwards with the staff was entertaining and educational (thanks David for the taco shop suggestions!). \n\nI'm completely blown away that Elements provides such amazing experiences. Based on this experience I will definitely return to Elements, and I'm headed for Petite Maison. \n\nTruly amazing",4

Once I sat in the drive-thru for 10 minutes while they tried to find it and then had to make a new one. I'm sure the 6 cars behind me LOVED that. I mean WTF, people. It's a goddamn croissant, stick it in the oven for a minute and hand it over, or if that's too difficult just put it in a bag and I'll microwave it at work.\n\nI'm fuming as I write this because I HATE being late for work. The line today for both drive-thru and inside were at least 10 people deep. I ordered regular coffee instead of a latte because I knew it would take forever. Got the croissant as a last-minute whim (What? I love croissants and having it stare at me from the case while I waited to place an order made it impossible to resist) and he asked if I wanted it warm. I asked how long, and he said just a minute. So I got my regular coffee and went over to put cream in it thinking I'm making good time. 5 minutes go by, I'm starting to pace because now I have to rush to work. Another 5 and then the people after me with 3 kids gets their breakfast sandwiches. WHAT THE $*%&. The guy goes, are you waiting for something? I said, YES a croissant for like 10 minutes. I'm in a  goddamn hurry. JESUS.

I had the mango chicken curry and my wife had the pineapple chicken curry and both were well balanced in flavor.

I guess they have a lot of invitation books for less, but that selection is not nearly as exciting or unique as the high end stuff.\n\nThe women who I met there were not friendly but not rude either - definitely tend to leave you alone to sort through things.\n\nI didnt end up ordering anything from here because I found beautiful invitations that looked very expensive for a lot less through Hallmark.\n\nBut this is a place I would definitely recommend to START (and possibly finish, if you're lucky) invitation shopping.

The music was pumping and lots of fun, but had we not been in the booth we wouldn't have been able to converse at all. \n\nThe cocktail menu is on an Ipad, so it was a interactive start to a fun evening. \n\nOur server was really attentive, and the only issue we had was that some of our orders didn't make it to the table at the same time (the side of rice and the shumai were tardy) but everything tasted delicious!  \n\nMy Miso Black Cod was SPECTACULAR.  Seriously silky and luxurious and a fairly large portion.  I was surprised that it was truly a la carte, so the described accompaniments were more garnish than side.  We ordered the charred asparagus for the table - topped with lemon preserve which made it all really interesting! \n\nEveryone loved what they ordered.  \nIn my humble opinion, while the sushi was excellent  and of superior quality, if you can get amazing sushi locally for less dinero (as we can at Azuki and Sushi Ota) then I'd recommend you order the Black Cod - something you cannot find everywhere.  It was to die for!\n\nDessert was whimsical:  we ordered the ice cream minis - such clean flavors.  My fave was the white chocolate cardamon.",4

The frame of the gate appears to be to big for the gate and it never looks like its closed all the way.\n\nThey did patch some of the stucco but still left some drill holes and large gaps on the sides of the frame that should have been filled in.

The atmosphere is very nice and service was fast to get seated and I loved the fact that they give you a Samsung Tablet to order your food whenever you want, it was quite fun.  \nThe fun, however, seemed to stop there.  The menu is quite full and some pictures looked really nice.  I ordered a grilled salmon and when received, it was a salmon belly (almost 80 percent fat) with the bone in it.  I asked the waitress about it and she said that this is the correct order and that I can eat the fat and skin which I refused.  She said that if I wanted a lean cut then I would need to order the Teriyaki Salmon.\nOk, ordered the new salmon and some more sushi and a gingered beef.  The server came in with her thumb in the sauce, really, right in the sauce of the ginger beef and happily left me with the dish.   Well, it costs a dollar to send food back and there was no plant close by to put the food in so I ate the part that was not in the sauce.\n\nThe sushi rolls are nice, the tempura was delicious but then I saw something on the menu that I just had to try, the Crab.  The description showed that it was crab meat in a light tempura.  I received the dish, well, maybe crab in Montreal is different from the Maritimes but we don't consider fake crab  meat made from arctic char as being crab.  \n\nI did have a very nice discussion with a lady at another table about the place, she said never come alone and order their full dishes with noodles, they are very delicious.

It was alright....it's a bit tart which I like, but I dunno...I think the bolder red makes more sense with tart fruits. \n\nNow the service was spotty and wait for items was kinda long. I however wasn't going to dock them down for it only because our server was very apologetic and really tried to help her tables. I looked around and the place was filled and  there wasn't enough staff coverage for the volume. I always feel bad when that happens because it's not the servers fault if they get spread thin. Someone could have called in and screwed everyone or upper management/owners haven't hired enough people. Tapas is about sitting around and chatting so I wasn't in a hurry. Just keep that in mind though- come when you feel like having a long nosh since speed and service isn't a strong suit. \n\nI'm a \""fan\"" so I put it up to a 4 star since my visit was positive, but it's a round up since there are some obvious hangups.",4
2249,0,"I've been to Gray's about a half a dozen times, different days of the week, different times of the day. Every time, the food is good (the veggie wrap is delicious), but not so much as to make me want to keep coming back. \n\nWhile the orders from the kitchen always come out quickly and correctly, the wait staff isn't impressive at all. If used items need to be cleared, you have to ask for it to be done. If a refill is desired, you need to ask and hope they come back. One thing I've never experienced anywhere before: each and every time I've been there, dishes have been dropped and broken. \n\nI wouldn't say no to going back if in a group but I certainly won't be the one to suggest returning.",2

The girl dropped one of the slices of bread from our salad onto the table and did not bring us a fresh slice. Our server wasn't rude exactly but I just got the vibe that she was bored and had no interest in being there. \n\nThe food is the reason why I'm giving this place 4 stars. The bruschetta was delicious, as was the house salad. The pizza was pretty good although I much prefer Piccolo Forno in Lawerenceville. Piccolo Forno has better pizza and service. \n\nOn a separate occasion we went for gelato. It's overpriced but it brought back memories from my semester in Italy so if was worth it.",0
2251,0,I would give service 5 stars! Great customer service.\n\nBut I only give the restaurant and food 2 stars. Like how the place is decorated. Feels very comfy in there. Just needs some art up on the walls. But the food was no good! Took very long for our food. There was only 2 other parties in the restaurant. I ordered a California Turkey sandwich. They forgot the avocado and put way too many chiles on the sandwich. I could of made a better one at home. My husband had a parm chicken sandwich and the chicken was burnt and over cooked. The chicken was also flat and way too thin. The chicken sandwich cost $12! Way over priced. We could come back if the quality of the food was better and not over price. Never even saw a manger. They did take the chicken sandwich off the bill but the manager never came over and talked to us. Poor management. I have worked in restaurants for years and know what kind of service restaurants should give.,0
2252,0,"Service and food is as good as it gets in a steakhouse. Pricing for Wagyu steak is fair, $90 for a 32 oz piece that two could share. Crabcake with Cajun sauce was delicious, but only one crabcake in the appetizer portion. The bread was nothing to write home about. The steak was the star of the evening, perfectly seasoned and prepared. We were licking the bone! They had prisoner by the glass, one of our favorite wines. Perhaps next time I would order the rib eye bone-in steak because the Wagyu, though melt-in-the-mouth tender, had too much fat for my liking.",4

Without getting into the painful details, the customer service we received was unbelievably bad.  They gave us a multi-thousand dollar written estimate (which required repeated requests to even get anything in writing) and it was hand-written on what appeared to be a scrap of paper.  So unprofessional.  Then, when we spoke with the sales team regarding a possible trade-in, given the price tag to fix my car, they were rude and inflexible. We couldn't get a straight answer or even a return call until ultimately we got in touch with the general manager of the dealership.  Apparently, they have had problems and she and her team are now trying to set things right.  She was the first and only person there that was helpful, and she certainly has tried to make things right.  That said, I was disappointed enough that I will not go back.  If you need a Mini dealer, definitely stick with North Scottsdale.  I promise that will save you a lot of time and frustration.",0

2259,0,"I recently purchased an iPhone 4. I did so via the apple.com website because I prefer shopping online for anything that doesn't need to be tried on... Saves me from having to deal with crowded malls, filled parking lots and overzealous sales people. \n\n4 weeks after ordering my new phone arrived. As most people are probably aware, there have been some issues with the newest version of the iPhone, and apple is offering free cases to people that have purchased the phone. You do not go to the store to get your free case, but I wanted to check out what other cases were available for purchase and I also needed some anti-glare film to prevent my screen from getting scratched. \n\nWhen I arrived at the apple store it was a zoo. It is usually a zoo though, they have all of their products out for people to try out and it always seems like there are a dozen people there trying out the fancy technology. No biggie though, at least I didn't think so at first. I had been to this store before, I knew where the cases were, so I made my way to the back of the store. Only to find there were absolutely no iPhone 4 accessories on the wall. No cases, no film, no replacement docking stations...\n\nAt that point, I was fairly certain my trip to the apple store was a bust, but I wanted to confirm that they did not have any back stock of merchandise. So I looked around for someone to ask. Didn't see any employees that looked available, most were running around like chickens with their heads cut off. Despite having a system where people can make appointments to get help from the Genius Bar, staffing seemed very disorganized. \n\nFinally an employee came over to the accessory area to show another customer some iPad items. I tried to make eye contact with the girl, get her attention in any possible way to make it clear that I needed some assistance when she was available. Sadly before she noticed me, or even finished with the person she was helping, another customer interrupted her to ask for help. This was not necessarily her fault, but had she been attentive of who was in the area she would have realized I had been waiting for help the entire time she was in the area. \n\nAfter she finished with the interrupting customer, she turned to yet another customer that had walked up just a moment earlier, and asked him if he needed assistance. Thankfully he was polite enough to point me out and explain that I had been waiting longer. Finally, I was going to get to ask my very simple question! Or maybe not. As I start to explain what I was looking for, another apple employee walks up and starts telling the employee that was helping me something. Um, excuse me? If you need to tell a co-worker something, and you are not able (or willing) to wait until they are done dealing with a customer, at least have the professionalism to excuse yourself before you cut that customer off.\n\nThere was no back stock. While I won't blame this specific location for not having items in stock that they really should have in stock, I can and do blame the management for not having more organization for the staff and better training on how to handle customers in a professional manner.",1
2260,0,"So, one of my Meetup groups had an outing planned here that I wasn't able to make but the name intrigued me.  Automatically I started thinking that I don't know if I would want to eat at a place that eludes to anything that is gastrointestinal related.  However, my curiosity continued to get the best of me despite the name, so I checked out the website.  I was impressed with what I saw.  I'm a crazy picky eater so there are some dishes on the menu that you couldn't pay me to try, but there were also several that excited my stomach.  I'm a music junkie so I became even more excited when I read that different local DJs hit the ones and twos every night!  I said to myself, \""Self, we are so going to Soul Gastrolounge!\""  \n\nOne of my friends and I met up there on a Friday night around 9:00 and the place was packed!  There's a really cool outdoor patio that overlooks the street and inside is dimly lit and full of a laid-back, eccentric vide.  I thought to myself, \""I've found where I belong (tear, sniffle, sniffle).\""  My friend and I were told that we would have an hour and 15 minute wait, which normally would've sent us packing but we were fully committed.  So, we chose to wait at Twenty-Two (check out my review) which is right below S.G.\n\nWhen it was time for us to be seated we were lead to a bar right by the DJ booth (who was awesome btw).  Our server came by in a matter of seconds to take our drink orders and then we perused the menu.  Since I had already looked at it online I decided to order the Soul Wings (I wasn't feeling as adventurous that night but trust me I'll going back to try oh so much more.) and the french fries with garlic-herb salt, pecorino & truffle oil.  The wings were okay but I loved the fries.  Our server came back to check on us several times throughout our stay and was pretty darn amazing.  \n\nI'll definitely be back here.  The food options are just about limitless, reasonably priced and the service was awesome.  I say \""YES\"" to Soul Gastrolounge and you should too!",4

I asked for tables upstairs in the daylight but there was allegedly no way to accommodate my request. Worst part about the basement is the thumping from the sub-woofer located above -- really ridiculous. Service was fine. Timing of drinks and first brunch course were acceptable given it was a busy day, but then gap of 35+ minutes for entrees left us all sitting there, not enjoying the dark of the basement nore the perpetually thumping base.

2276,0,"I wanted to give 2.5 stars.  The food was pretty good, definitely better than average for Madison BBQ.  There were a few disappointments that have been mentioned by a few other reviews, such as the Sweet Baby Ray's sauce instead of homemade variations.  The beef brisket, although tender, was a little on the dry side and lacked flavor.  The pulled pork and ribs were much better.  Oddly enough, the cole slaw comes with the dressing on the side.  With most salads, this is what I prefer, but cole slaw needs time for the dressing to marinate cabbage, a green that's not made to just be eaten raw without some kind of major seasoning.  The Mexican street corn was delicious and unique to Madison.  The bread that came with the dinners had an odd flavor, like it had been deep fried in old oil.  If they could kick up the quality of the sides, I think the food could be really really good.  All in all, I'd have given the food 3.5-4 stars.  \n\nWhat brought the score down was the odd service and the setting.  The folks that take your order seem to be pretty disorganized and slow, whether it's the man that rang up my order incorrectly and kept asking me personal questions (not the owner Pete), or the young 10 year-old girl, who although cute, reminds me a little of child labor.  The place itself is a huge warehouse with a random, eery cowboy statue at the checkout counter.  \n\nI can see this place being really good if they can kick up the food a little and get a better-trained staff.  Right now I still prefer Smoky Jon's BBQ on the East side.",0

Sandwiches, omelettes, and french toast are all pretty good and portions are decent (not huge, but decent).\n\nIt's become something of a fixed hangout in the Mile End, which is saying a lot because Parc Avenue has this reputation of killing every establishment that tries to thrive within the first 6 months.",0

She laid it on the table and said in her snotty tone: \""Be prepared, you're gonna be filling out A LOT of these tonight!\"" The only other words she communicated to us were rude, as well. Of course, the rest of the night, we didn't sign one single waiver. We told Amy we just wanted the two shots and then we'd like the check, but she didn't come back for another twenty minutes after giving us the shots! WE had to flag her down to get her to finally come back to the table, and the place wasn't busy at all. My fianc\u00e9 and I had been to this Gallagher's many times before and loved it, but Amy ruined our experience and we won't be coming back.  \nWe came in smiling and she totally killed the mood.",1

2300,0,I rented a mini van for ten days. We realized after two days the door didn't lock. A few days later we got a flat tire. Hertz said I could put on the spare and drive 80 mles to the ElPaso airport or stay in the town overnight and get a van at the local branch. We decided to stay the night in a hotel. In the morning the local Hertz had NO vehicles so I had to drive To ElPaso ( over two hr round trip). When i returned the vehicle and talked to the manager she just gave me a blank stare and told me that she is not required to compensate me because i booked through Priceline. Oh well I still saved 50%.,0
2301,0,"Unlike another store I reviewed recently, I regard Backtracks as a bit of a junk store, but one I find has some charm.\n\nA small shop near Tollcross, slightly obscured by a bus shelter in front of it, Backtracks is a shop you could easily miss. It is, as its title suggests, primarily a music and games shop (amongst some other... \""stuff\""). I am a bit of a music and games fan. Whenever I've been in, I've found a few treats regards the CD collection, as I rake through their collection. A great deal of them however, like others have found, I have never heard of in my life, and don't expect to hear of.\n\nAs for games, I would probably recommend elsewhere for the latest releases. Don't necessarily expect to find anything produced in the past five years. having said that, if you're a collector you mind come across some unexpected finds, especially on the retro line.\n\nPrices are reasonable for the sort of shop it is. The owner is friendly enough. Browsing can become a little difficult with the shops small space, and chaotic and precarious arrangement.",0

When I got there I was immediately greeted and met with my consultant Rhonda. Oh Rhonda! She took everything I said into consideration! I was set on the trumpet style dress, but was open to other styles. Rhonda ran around the store twice pulling dresses within our budget! I found my dress in our first round! I did try on 5 total, each with great merits and parts I had told her I wanted. But #3 was the one I fell in love with. Rhonda also helped alot as far as veils and tiaras went, bringing the whole experience into all that it would be on my wedding day! I met with a store manager as well (Erica I believe?)

2306,0,"Would never eat in this restaurant again.  Lousy food and the service was worse.  Took a friend there who came in from Florida.  Our friend ordered a cup of soup before dinner and it came out in only what I can describe as something not much bigger than a thimble.  Then the waitress tells us that this is their sampler so our friend ordered a bowl of soup.  It was huge.  We laughed so hard.  The food was supposed to be Mexican.  But having spent considerable time at some of the best restaurants in Mexico, the food here would be laughable if it wasn't so bad.  No flavor, nothing.  Really not good.  And the waitress.  Talk about attitude.  Kept calling our friend \""missie\"" or \""me lady\"".  Seriously?  Let me give you a hint.  You are a waitress, not the Queen.  Being a waitress or waiter is a tough job so we go out of our way to be nice.  Not a job that I would want.  But, your job is to be nice, give good service, etc.  The wait staff here needs serious traiining.  I was watching one of the waiters put plates on the tables.  He would neatly lay out the plates and then to position, he would put his hand in the middle of the plate, palm down, to shift if around, to put it in place.  Not sure where his hand had been before placing the plates, but what a turn-off.  Hopefully he just didn't come from the bathroom, or worse.  This place is nothing more than an embarassment.  So sorry to have taken our out of town friend to this place.  If it lasts a year I would be surprised.",0

I love their pad thai, their Thai fried rice with shrimp and vegetables, and make sure to get their egg rolls. You get three in an order, and they're delicious. \n\nIt's primarily a takeout place, so there are just a few tables in a family-owned restaurant. But stop in!",4
2310,0,"Been here twice--once with friends when I only ordered a crepe, and once again with dad, when I ordered death by fine French decadence.  We had la Potence and the assorted cold cuts sampler with the melted Raclette cheese service.  Quick snapshot of the general aim of the restaurant: my dad asked if they had French onion soup, but the waiter just chuckled and said they try not to be *that* kind of French restaurant.  \n\nLa Potence: you order it, they wheel it out and set it on fire, and slowly you pick off the hanging chunks of meat and slather it in the buttery sauces they give you.  Initially I was actually a little bit disappointed; sure they set it on fire, but it's only a handful of meat with five different variations of butter--for $$$.  But don't be an idiot like me!  The pineapple they drape over the top isn't there just to be fancy--it actually does tenderize the meat, and plays off nicely with the whiskey juice they pour over the whole apparatus.  The butter sauces could be punchier--but remember, this is French food, not Thai.  All of the juices that drip off the meat goes into a skillet of wild rice, which is simple but delicious.\n\nAssorted Cold Cuts with Raclette: again, they bring out an underwhelming assortment of meats, and then they wheel out this strange contraption attached to a formerly-whole wheel of raclette.  There's a set amount of cheese melting services they provide, and you can choose to split them up instead of getting it all at once.  Anyways, this turned out to be just the right serving size, otherwise I'd be dead from a heart attack instead of writing this review.  Everything seems so deceptively simple, but it's rich beyond compare, and I really missed good European deli meats.  The piece de la resistance was when I arranged the la potence beef, surrounded by the rice, heaped on top of the cold cuts and cut up potatoes, and had them cover the whole schmear with raclette.  \n\nAmazingly, we still had room for dessert.  My dad had the chocolate lover's crepe (I forget the name, but it was aimed towards chocoholics--he wasn't that impressed), and I had the frangipani--which was delicious, almondy heaven.  My dad ordered a coffee, and while he was initially disappointed that they didn't have any way to make it hazelnut-flavored, all was forgiven when the waiter brought out the coffee press.  We're no coffee snobs, but this coffee was the most fragrant brew I had ever tasted; putting hazelnut in it would've been a waste of damn good coffee. \n\nWaiter was friendly.  I don't remember his name, but he's the older guy with the glasses.  He explained the whole process of setting the meat on fire and melting the cheese like a tour guide, and made the experience very pleasant.\n\nYes this place is potentially hard on your arteries and your wallet, but this is our new place for rare, indulgent special occasions--so hopefully now my LDL is back to normal.",4
2311,0,"Wahoo's is pretty decent.  Their service is top notch but I feel their fish taco's can use a little more kick -- perhaps a little acidity and spice to the fish.\n\nTheir mild green sauce is pretty good but I really enjoyed Mista Ree's sauce the best.  It tastes like the main ingredient is Korean hot chili paste.  The cajun and grilled fish is pretty mild, so I would smother the sauce all over the taco's.\n\nThe taco platters are huge.  You get a big heaping serving of rice and black beans.  Seriously, you can probably share the meal with a friend.\n\nTheir chicken tortilla soup was also very tasty - very homey with a little bit of heat.\n\nOverall, Wahoos serves fresh ingredients and huge portions of food for extremely reasonable prices.  I just think the taco's could use a little more to kick it up a notch.",2
2312,0,"Rosatti's doesn't deliver to Verona (I can't blame them), so we decided to call Falbo's.  And that's when we discovered Falbo's in Verona closed and is now \""AJ's Pizzeria and Diner\"" (thankfully the phone number is the same).\n\nAn extremely helpful and friendly gentleman answered the phone, informed us of the recent change, and offered their web address so that we could browse the new menu.  After a quick peek, we called back and placed the order: spinach cheese bread, a garden salad, and a large thin crust pie with the gold-standard for toppings (sausage, onion, mushroom, green peppers).\n\nWe were quoted a delivery time of around 40 minutes, which seemed totally fair.  After we hung up and poured a glass of vino, the phone rang - a computer glitch wiped out part of the delivery address; the gentleman was extremely apologetic - it wasn't a big deal at all.  These guys seem like super friendly and helpful folks.\n\nAfter less than 25 minutes, the doorbell rang and our bounty had arrived.  The driver was very professional and friendly as well - seems like they want to really make a good impression with their customers.  \n\nWe started with the salad; it was huge, and very fresh.  The slices of tomato were a bit unusual, but all things considered, the salad was good.  It featured cukes, tomato, onion, bell peppers and croutons (which appeared to be pre-made).\n\nFrom the salad, we tried the spinach cheese bread, which featured a french loaf, cut in half, buttered, and topped with fresh spinach and mozzarella cheese, which was then baked/melted.  The bread wasn't real crisp - my guess is that it sat in the styrofoam container too long and probably steamed itself a bit.  We saved it and will reheat it in the oven.\n\nThe pizza looked excellent - perfect thickness of the crust; plenty of uber-fresh toppings, and just the right amount of cheese.  We dug-in, and while the outer part of the crust was nice and crisp, the center had gone soft, just like the spinach cheese bread did.  Again, I'm guessing it's because we left it in the box for too long, or that the fresh veggies ended-up steaming the pizza a bit as it cooked?  \n\nDespite the flopping inner crust, the pizza was superb.  The sauce was excellent, the sausage was delish, and the veggies were cut thin and piled high.  We both ate more than we should've, but it tasted soooo good we couldn't stop ourselves.\n\nI'll definitely order from AJ's again, and will ask for the crust to be a little more well done.  I also wonder if a sheet of parchment or something on the bottom during transport would help keep things more crisp?  \n\nI wish these guys the best of luck with the new venture.  Give them a try!\n\nAJ's = WIN\n\nFood = 3.5 stars\nService = 5 stars (fast, friendly, helpful)\nValue = 4.25 stars\n\nI'd prefer to rate AJ's as 3.5 - 3.75 stars, but aside from the softish crust, it was a 4+ star experience, so we'll bump 'em up a bit.",2

2320,0,"Monday at 9:30 pm is when I walked in with my date.  They close at 10:00pm this night.  Two (2) of Carrabba's employees sees us waiting at the host stand, just stares at us for a monument and walks away as if they contemplated whether to greet us or not.  My date and I wait a little longer while few more employees walk around us without any acknowledgement.  So we decided to seat ourselves.  Another customer that was leaving aided us with the menu.   After sitting, the first employee that recognized us at the host stand ends up being our server/waitress, but that wasn't until much later.   \n\nThis is what I witnessed while i waited for service.  There was an employee moving tables around and vacuuming the floors around the table my date and I were sitting in.  This may be a little extreme, but why not really disgust guest by picking noses and farting next to dining guests?  The others were focused on the side work as well in preparation to close and leave.  Yet during cleaning up the restaurant floor, they small spec of crumbs were vacuumed but the food on the floor a few tables down from us was left alone.  I still don't understand their priorities.   The restaurant was fairly empty the this time with me being the 4th or 5th table to dine.  \n\nI give this place one (1) star only because I cannot go any lower.  I never expected to enter a dining establishment where the employees showed such disappointment because dining guests shows up 30 minutes before closing time.  The term \""going above and beyond\"" is not what this particular Carrabba's is taught, so I can only assume.  That assumption come from speaking with the manager for that night.  I was I got her name, but failed to do so because I just wanted to leave after her condescending responses.  She actually said \""well I can't be out here all the time\"" as an excuse when I explained to her the chain of events they led me to just leave.  Yes, just leave.  Not only was the server rude, she sounded annoyed that she had to explain the menu.   \n\nGoing back to the manager, I have a strong conviction that managers are to manage.  The manager for that shift is to blame for either the lack of proper training or the lack of care the employees show to their guests.  \n\nSo we leave and go to Apple Bees across the street.  The bartender there greeted us as we walked in.  The server sat us strategically so they could continue their side work without interfering with my dinging experience whereas Carrabba's just didn't care.   \n\nAll Carrabba's cannot be this bad.  I'm hoping this does not happen often, not because I care where this business goes but because it would bother me to know this happens regularly to other unsuspecting guests.   I'm sure if I decided to stay and dine at Carrabba's and leave a low or no gratuity, I can only assume they would have cursed me under their breath for being a bad tipper and not being accountable for horrible service.",0

2322,0,"I have wanted to see this ever since I turned 18 because I am fascinated by the idea of sophisticated nudity.  Anyway, I finally got to go and it was a total disappointment.  The opening and closing numbers were quite impressive, and what I expected (the stage was full, large costumes, etc.) but the middle parts were strange story lines that didn't make sense, a ton of men singing and dancing (I wanted to see showGIRLS!)  and the worst part was the choreography: the timing was way off and everyone looked like they had a different style of doing everything.  I was expecting to be amazed at the precision but was totally let down.\n\nI will say that the interludes they had between the numbers was quite good.  There was a pair of men doing acro stuff, a man on silks and a gentleman who twirled these giants shapes in the air, and when the light caught the metallic of the shapes, it created a sort of psychedelic color thing.  We were more entertained by the interludes than anything else.\n\nThe set piece for the Titanic was cool, though.

2326,0,"I give it a 1 for location because I have to. I've been here less than a month and everything I've read, I've experienced so far. Car window smashed the first week. Fire alarms went off for an hour tonight. I've seen 1 cockroach in bathtub. My car was backed into and dented. This is a great area but not a great place to live. I unfortunately moved here sight unseen as I was confidentily reassured by the staff (Alex) that these complaints weren't true. They've all happened to me so far. Only 12 months to go, joy. Positives: nice pool, above average fitness facility for an apartment community and some good people. Live and learn, this will be a 13 month experience.\n\nI wrote the above blurb after the first month but never posted and didn't expect to see it here, so kind of interesting to add the full review below with a one month review. After 5 months I couldn't take it anymore and paid $1200 to get out of my lease and my full review below.\n\nThis place is bad news. Where to start? First week my window was smashed on my Tahoe and nothing was stolen, just $260 to replace it. Second, someone backed into my front bumper causing a nice dent. Fortunately, I have a 2002 so I'm not concerned about needing it fixed. There isn't much parking, making you park in unlit or unprotected areas. I believe the safest area is up by the tennis courts. It was inconvenient, but the problems stopped except for the dent.\n\nIn my 5 months of a 13 month lease, I paid $1200 to get out of here early. The parking is tight, you will get door dings.  The community has useless security guards that basically lock the pool doors. A mouse is more intimidating. \n\nI've heard the fire alarms go off 4 times from drunks in the middle of the night. I've seen two cockroaches in my apartment and they were huge. The garbage area literally almost made me puke in unit E (if you must live here, make sure it isn't by a garbage room). I'd say 50% of residents pick up after their dogs, so crap everywhere. The water pressure in my unit was horrible. The heat and air conditioning is controlled by management. I had to keep my sliding glass door open at night because it was unbearably hot. I had a smoker above and to the left of me so I got to inhale there smoke because I had to leave the door open so I didn't melt. The laundry facilities are NASTY. The water just stands in the machines. If you go inside a machine and shake it you will hear the recycled water. Always check the dryer as people before you don't care about leaving nasty hairs or other nasty stuff behind. Two units in E were constantly broken. The cost is $1.25 and you have to use a laundry card. You lose it and it is $25 to replace. If you don't use it alll upon leaving, the next tenant thanks you. \n\nYour only option for television is DirecTV. The maximum lease you can sign is a 13 month lease, the minimum contract with DirecTV is a 24 month agreement. Getting out of that contract was a nightmare. I typically get contracts when you have a choice, here the equipment is installed and you have no choice. Yet, DirecTV will give you the BS line that they have to account for equipment costs. I am moving into a residence that already has DirecTV and they still didn't let me out of the contract. \n\nLast, I went to turn in my keys today thinking I had paid my rent Jan 1 thinking it was good through my early move out date of 2/6. Nope, and no bill. I find out today I had a $178 worth of rent for 6 days, a $50 late fee and another $40 in $10 a day accruals. \n\nThe community leasing agents will act like they care, but they know they work for a terrible management company with no sympathy for honest mistakes. They kind of just go silent when confronted and pray you walk away. There hands are tied. Two of them are easy to find. they are always outside smoking. Last, I moved in sight unseen over the internet. I was handed my keys and never even given a tour. I had to find everything on my own. The only good thing about it I guess is the location, but I'd find a different location to live in the area. If you want to live in a dorm style community, this is the place. I have lived in many communities over the years and I've never left a place on a sour note. This is the worst 5 months of living I've ever had.\n\nPro's: Location, Gym is decent for an apartment community, nice pool, convenient store. I will not say price because it all adds up in misery.",0

The music was loud and thumping, and we literally had to yell to have a conversation. It was during happy hour so I'm not sure if that is why, but all the same it didn't help the experience. I don't mind loud music, but it definitely didn't feel appropriate in this restaurant. I guess I'd go back, but maybe I'll just take someone I don't really want to talk to. ;-)",2
2334,0,"This place is the bomb. Whether you land at Terminal 2 and take the 1 minute train over or if you're already I. Terminal 1, get your Vegas weekend liquor and supplies here! Their prices are same as what you would pay in any big city liquor store. (Absolut for $24.99, most other rums, tequilas and whiskeys same price range.) they have mixers as well as soft drinks, fresh lemons and limes which they will cut for you. Hop in the taxi line right outside and head to your hotel! Easy, cheap and way fast. They must have at least 50 brands of every kind of liquor too, so they will definitely have what you want. I paid $60 for tequila, mix, limes and orange juice. We had two margaritas at Cosmopolitan and the bill was $35 w tip, to give you an idea how much money you'll be saving. I'll definitely come back.",4

2338,0,"I absolutely love the food here. I've never tasted anything I don't 100% love. The Tokyo ramen with beef is my go to, but the Shoyu and Tonkotsu ramens are delicious as well. The location is great, and the hours aren't bad. I do kind of wish they were open a bit later, I think they'd do well with all the college kids in town!  My only downside to this place is the service. For the most part, you encounter rude, blank staring college kids who are counting down the minutes until their shifts are over. I've never had the pleasure of being greeted by someone friendly! I return for the food, but the service needs a serious improvement.",0
2339,0,"Upon walking into the office I was a bit perplexed. I thought I was entering a free clinic. I'm still not sure. My appointment was for 1pm. I wasn't seen until 1:50pm.

Nonetheless I saw Bryan Monson, at least I think it was Bryan Monson, perhaps it was (Silver Surfer: Can enter Hyperspace. tied Nova He can enter Hyperspace as well. tied Green Lantern)the whole appointment lasted 1 minute 35 seconds.

Helloooo?\n\nWe were pre-gaming in Summerlin then moved on to Banger Brewery but that wasn't enough so we came here for more drinks and shenanigans. We went down the slide a few times - I recommend curling up into a ball once you're in the tube. I had my legs stretched out the first time and I got stuck. This is a playground for big kids and I love it! You have to be at least 21 and they will check for ID. If they had swings, I wouldn't want to leave this place. 5 stars!\n\nThey have a jerky shop, clothing stores, cupcakes, frozen treats, barber place, BBQ, wine bar, a bar with beer and cocktails...but none serve fries. 1 star!\n\nWe went to a bar and witnessed a tall guy bitch slap a smaller guy with what looked like a paper bag from Mac (not Mac as in Apple but Mac cosmetics). Is this how hipsters fight? Too much PBR. I was confused as I've never seen such wussy fighting. There was too much smiling and too much talking, not enough punching. That \""fight\"" was too G-rated so being 21 to get in CP was not warranted. Cops were in the BBQ place - if I were a cop, I'd continue enjoying my BBQ than waste my time on those people.\n\nSo yeah, the concept is a bunch of stacked containers turned into stores. I wonder if they'll have a dumpster jacuzzi. Hmmm...lots of drinks and shenanigans were definitely had.",0
2341,0,"I was craving sushi, my fiance was craving teppanayki so Osaka seemed like the perfect place to have both. \n\nI liked how they seemed to purposely make sure each teppanyaki party got it's own table and chef. This could have been because they were mostly empty, but I did appreciate having our own table. \n\nSushi was just OK. It was tightly rolled and they had a nice selection, but the negi hama I had was just OK. Not rotten, not super fresh.. just eh. I did love, however, that they offered half rolls. It was great to be able to get some variety. For ~$15 I was able to try 3 1/2 rolls.. this worked out really well. The rolls with all cooked stuff (shrimp tempura, etc) were great.. but that's hard to screw up. \n\nTeppanyaki was pretty good. Filet mignon was off the hook - seriously the best steak I've had at a  teppanyaki place..very tender and cooked really well. The chicken, sadly, was random end pieces and not too great. Lots of chewy grisley pieces.. eww. The fried rice and veggies were just average. \n\nOverally not a *bad* place , but nothing special. As teppanyaki and sushi are pretty expensive, I'd probably only come back here for the lunch specials. I'm not sure the quality justifies the dinner prices.",0

I guess it can be. \n\nI'm still trying to find a good place for boba, teas and snacks in Vegas and my quest has come up with nothing so far. I tried Tea Station out one afternoon after having lunch with some friends in Chinatown. I've been to the ones in SoCal before and expected it to be pretty much the same thing. \n\nI guess it was okay. I had a green milk tea with grass jelly regular size and it came out to about $5.. It was a little pricey and the grass jelly was just alright.\n\nHowever, this place has a HUGE menu and selection of teas, milk teas, smoothies, etc and a food menu as well! I think if I were to come back, I want to try their popcorn chicken (Chinese popcorn chicken, mind you) which I have been craving!\n\nTea Station is in the same plaza as Ichiza and parking can be a toughie sometimes since there are a very limited number of spots in the plaza so may the parking deities be with you on your quest as well!",4
2344,0,"Disgusting...blah.  I am not real picky when it comes to casual restaurants.  But I have to admit, some of this food was barely edible.  The calamari was so chewy, it tasted like rubber.  The turkey burger ordered by one comrade came out pink.  That is a little scary since turkey really should be thoroughly cooked.  My eggplant ravioli was tolerable but made my husband gag.  One person ordered the pastrami sandwich and picked at it...and I have to say, we are not the kind to snub our noses at good sandwiches.  The only thing that was pretty good was the chicken pot pie.  \n\nOn top of the nasty food, our waitress seemed completely stoned.  It took her 10 minutes to get us our drinks and she would disappear for several minutes at a time.  When we asked her questions, she had not clue what the answer was and had to go ask someone else.  Seriously incompetent.  So, my suggestion is to steer clear of this place.",0
2345,0,"When I walked in and saw the person at the front desk on a personal call, I knew I should have turned around and left. She did not end the call while I stood there. There was no one else in the waiting room. If I was feeling better I would have found some place else to go. \nShe finally finishes her call and acknowledges me. I complete the required paperwork. I go to bring it to her and she is on another call with a patient. She saw me walk up with my paperwork and place it on the counter in front of her. Another person walks in, she ends her call and proceeds to help the next person, after taking all her info she stands up and says to me \""why didn't you tell me you completed your paperwork\"". I did not even answer her as I knew I would have been rude. She calls me up, tells me I have to pay completes the transaction. I sit back down. The lady from back calls me back. Asks what is wrong, asks about medicines I am taking and my history. I am telling her everything, and she keeps asking me how do you spell it. Everything I said she could not spell. OK, I know medicines and diagnosis are not easy to spell but seriously, I was getting pretty annoyed at this. Plus all the while she is sniffling, I was already sick and the last thing I need is for it to get worse. \nThe Doctor came in a few minutes later, and says hello and says you have the flu. Alrighty then, I could have told her that myself. that is why I have not gone anywhere till today. She finally says well let me take a look, we are talking about my headaches, she says well I can't diagnosis headaches, you should to to the ER for a cat scan. That was it for me. A cat scan for the flu. She tells me to rest for two more days she will give me a note for my employer. Pick up the note up front. I get back to the front ask for my note. My favorite receptionists says we only give those if you ask. I reply the Doctor told me to come get it, not the other way around. I honestly could not take another minute of this so called urgent care. I said i do not need the note and left. I do not need the note. I do not call in to work, so I am not worried. \nThe bottom line is this place is a sham for an urgent care. If you are ill, honestly go to your own Dr. if you can, Even quick care is better than this. \nI give it two stars because my crankiness may be playing a part in how I am writing this. I am trying to be fair., by taking into consideration I do not feel well.",0

The bartender was very nice and the drink was appropriately strong, and the table waiter was also very pleasant to 4 of us. The place was not that happening on this particular night  - I think it's partly because of the holiday emptiness the college town experiences + ultra cold night - so no body was kicking us out of the door in hurry. We stayed and chatted long after taking care of the bills, and they didn't seem to care. \n\nHas the food been authentic or anything close to that, the dining experience would have been a bit more pleasurable on palate, but over all, not too much to complain about.",4

2350,0,"let me start off by saying the food itself was definitely a 5. my boyfriend and I split yakitori and onigiri, and I had a pork rice bowl (very fatty but the stuff I did eat was delicious) and my boyfriend got a tuna and salmon salad special from the wall. we also got wine specials from the wall which was only 4 dollars a glass - amazing! the prices were pretty decent overall. we ate as much as we could. now for the not so great part:\n\nwe sat at the bar, it was SO HOT we lost our appetites. the service was good but know it was more of a communal effort than one server. also the food just came out randomly when it was ready not like appetizers then meals. fine with me but some people might not be cool with that. also the place was TINY. we had to wait about 2 minutes to sit, which was fine, but the line was pretty bad when we were leaving.",0

Our other friends checked into a room that was already occupied (OOPS) so they bumped them up to the \""red rooms\"" which are SO MUCH NICER. Not really suites or anything so i'm not sure why they cost more but I would rather stay in those rooms with new tv's and beds then the old fashioned pink and green rooms below. \nThe only annoyance is the elevators don't all go up so you always have to come back down to the lobby and switch elevators if you have friends staying just a few floors away. I think if you get a deal, stay here. If you are going to spend over $100 take it to the Mandalay Bay or somewhere else a little more up market.",0

2354,0,"I ordered flowers, a bear, and chocolates for my wife for our anniversary (from FTD). The flowers that were delivered were half dead. The bear looked as if it was picked up at the dollar store with the eyes glued to the top of the head - threads hanging off every seam - and strands of dried glue strung across the surface near the hands, feet, and nose where there was a piece of cheap felt glued on. The chocolates came in a flimsy plastic heart-shaped container (that was broken) that, again, looked as if it had come from the dollar store. The \""chocolates\"" were actually an assortment of those little strawberry hard candies, cheap chocolate coins, and other similar novelty candies - not the Ethel-M, Sees, or Godiva chocolates that you would expect for the price. \n\nI called to complain that I did not get what I paid for. The lady on the phone was very helpful. She sent out a replacement arrangement the next day. Sadly, the same company delivered. My wife went to the reception area in her office to pick up the replacement arrangement, bear, and chocolates. The delivery person demanded that she return the items that she had received the day before. She told them that she gave them to her husband to return (I was planning on returning them myself the same day). So, the delivery person said sorry, and took the replacement arrangement back!!! \n\nI called FTD the same day and got a full refund.",0
2356,0,Ended up here on a whim. We needed a dog friendly patio. The staff was very knowledgeable and friendly. I had the street tacos with sea bass. Amazing! My husband had the bison burger with the kale salad. He loved it. The cocktails were fantastic. I wish Fox would open one here in Tucson.,3

2358,0,"At first glance from the outside, you aren't sure what to make of this establishment.  GO INSIDE.  The venue is split into some (private) dining tables when you first walk in and then the bar area behind double glass doors to the left.  Once you walk to the left you are normally greeted by the friendly bartender and have a wide range of options to sit / game / dine / imbibe.  At the bar, with numerous options on draft (Stone IPA - we have a winner), you can't go wrong while playing your favorite video poker game.  If gambling isn't your strong suite, walk over to their ULTIMATE MAN CAVERN.  They have the following available:  Darts, Shuffleboard, OFF ROAD (best game ever), NBA Jam, Street Fighter, Deer Hunter and of course every drinking establishment's GO-TO, Golden Tee.\n\nWe come by here at least once a week for lunch and the Crispy Flat bread pizza w/ Buffalo Chicken and Blue Cheese Spread is a staple, however their chicken tenders (never frozen) and Burgers have never let me down.\n\nThere is an abundance of flat screen TV's available and this is a Seahawk's Bar so I already know come Sunday, this place will be teaming with Russell Wilson and Marshawn Lynch fans.  Great place to just hang out and unwind after a long day / week / month / year.  \n\nSunni is an extremely friendly and knowledgeable bartender there so if she's working, go with her recommendations.",4

2366,0,"Your waitress took an accusatory tone and was rude with us when she screwed up our order, even after we tried to behave in a polite and understanding way with her when she did, and all you could do as manager was reinforce her negative behavior with similar behavior of your own when I brought this to your attention. If she can't behave professionally, why the hell is she waiting tables there in the first place?

It is just a-ok.\n\nService was not a problem, we were promply greeted and served.  We order some garlic knots and they came out very fast.  They were just okay, need more garlic and more parmesean!\n\nKevin and I decided to make our own pizza.  The pizza was just okay, I do like the crust, but the flavor of the pizza as a whole, is just okay.  Other people complained about cost, you get a nice value with a large pizza, but for just okay food, it seems overpriced.  We did have leftovers, and the box they give you is not large enough unless you are fine with stacking slices ontop of slices.  I will say a plus is that their pizza does cook well and tastes the same as a leftover the next day.\n\nI think the reason this gets even 3 stars is because it is very convenient for us and I do like the atmosphere in the inside. However, the Chicken and Mexican places are a much better eat in this shopping place.",2
2368,0,"I'm in love with Sage. \n\nI hemmed and hawed for months when I was charged with the duty of finding a really great fancy (and not too expensive) restaurant for me and my 20 closest girl friends. Seriously. I settled on Sage. Two things pushed me towards this restaurant-- the vegetarian friendly menu (we had vegetarians and a vegan) and that they wouldn't force us to get prix fixe if we split the group in two. Also a bonus-- this place is extremely reasonable for being in Vegas and for the quality of food and service.\n\nThe two group split worked perfectly because they sat us in the back room RIGHT next to eachother so we could walk between tables ooh'ing and aah'ing and TASTING. One table got the chef's tasting and another ordered what they felt like. The server at my table was fantastic; SO helpful and sweet and never impatient (even though it was all very confusing at some points with all the girls shuffling and shouting). They allowed some of us to pay cash and others to use their credit cards. They brought us everything we wanted basically. Impeccable service, period. \n\nAll the cocktails I tasted were incredible. All the food I tasted was perfectly seasoned and never boring. Highlights include the foie gras brulee, the hanger steak, New York strip, steak tartare, slow poached farm egg. Another very awesome thing was that the chef made a special amuse bouche and dish for our lone vegan friend. She was asked about what she didn't like and she was brought out this totally unique and impressive dish-- she looked SO content. Honestly, everything was fantastic because my friends all toasted me and gushed all weekend about it. I am so so happy I went with Sage.",4

2374,0,"You get a nice view from atop this sketchy Vegas icon.  The observation deck is high above the casino and hotel below and allow you to see the entire city.  The outdoor deck give you an  up close look at the rides that nearly defy logic.  It seems strange to install an amusement park on top of a tower as they did but it works.  People get their thrills up there every day (weather permitting).  I've only ever done the Sky Jump myself.  The other rides just aren't my style.  When I go up in the Stratospher Tower it is almost solely for the view.  There are a few problems with it though.  Admission is $18.  $12 for locals.  All you get for that is a ride in an elevator.  Sure, it runs at 21 MPH and takes you up the core in less than a minute but the simple fact remains that it is nothing more than an elevator.  Second problem, trying to figure out where to purchase admission.  I was there on Friday taking advantage of the January special for locals (free admission Fri, Sat, Sun all January long).  I stood in one line near the entrance to the elevators.  They told me to go to the box office.  I went to the box office and it was dark.  Security told me to go down stairs to the other box office on the casino level.  Then I had to go all the way back to where I started and stand in line for a while as each elevator can only take 10 people.  When you have a long line 10 people at a time makes for slow progress.  Neverthless, the wait is worth it when you reach the top and see the magnificence of the Las Vegas Valley.\n\nAs for the casino, not bad.  It is big and mostly modern looking.  Its fairly clean and doesn't seem to smell too strongly of smoke like some casinos do.  My favorite part though is near the casino level box office mentioned above.  There is a nice Dale Earnhardt Sr. Chevrolet Camaro and the Stratosphere Pole Award given to the pole sitter of the Kobalt Tools 400 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway every March.

It was way too strong eating multiple whole peppercorns in each bite. It completely overpowered the taste. Secondly, I LOVE Gorgonzola but they put way too much on the sandwich making it way too salty. The Tu Bock Shakur was great. Patio setting was awesome. Service was not so great. I will be back for the beer and hopefully the next menu item I try won't be as extremely disappointing.",1
2380,0,"What a Burger!! Outstanding, and they throw in the free entertainment outside.  While I visited some of the natives became restless.  Batman got punched in the face by an urban youth who was quickly arrested.  Anyway 3 fat burgers, fries, a milkshake and coke later I was more than satisfied.  My only question-Why the need for a turkey burger? We are American over here, keep the turkey for those silly Canadians...Anyways-What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas and I just dropped off a truckload of evidence!!!",4
2381,0,"There were no fewer than 15 people working here the day that I went with very few people in all of Tivoli Village. I wasn't greeted by the two women who were enjoying their conversation upon my entrance, and then the same two women greeted the people behind me warmly. Then some other women who worked there were watching me like a hawk as if I had sticky fingers and was pilfering everything that I touched. So I was either totally invisible to the staff or I was a 14 year old with a couple of friends seeing how much I could throw in my bag and up my sleeves.\n\nBasically they sell H&M or Forever 21 accessories for higher prices. I'm not confident that paying more for their products would make my skin green less quickly. It's still a cheaply produced product. You could find some good stuff on clearance or as-is here, but I wouldn't ever buy anything full price here because it's definitely not quality goods.",0
2382,0,"The M Resort is the first place you'll spot if you're driving into Vegas. \n\nI was pretty impressed with my first visit here. \nSome of things that I liked are the following: \nThe lobby has beautiful real lilies on the wall. \nThey have complimentary drinks that are self serve in the main casino. \nThey have TVs around the main casino that showcase live sports games. \nThe buffet is superb! \n\nThe buffet on Fridays, Saturdays and Sunday is a seafood buffet priced at around $27. They have an abundant amount of crab legs, different types of sushi, shrimp, salmon, mahi mahi etc. \n\nThe buffet is international and so you have your pick of what types of food you want to sample from around the world. I enjoyed their different types of Thai curry (panang, green, and yellow). I also became an instant fan of tomato soup here. \n\nOne of the best things about the buffet is the desert section. \nThey have cannolis, gelato, crepes, creme brulee, flan and much, much more. \n\nAnother bonus point of the buffet is they offer free wine and free cappuccino, lattes and other speciality coffees at their buffet. \n\nLastly, I noticed that within the casino itself they would have a raffle almost every 15 minutes. They would call out the numbers of different casino card holders and the winners would win cool prizes like trips to Big Bear, $10,000 etc. I'm not sure how authentic the raffle is since we noticed the numbers always called out seemed to be a way lower number then what any of the card holders had on their cards (at least for the party I was with =P) but hey if it is for real...it's pretty cool. \n\nAnyways this place is pretty rockin! Classy looking and excellent food. I can easily see it working it's way to become a new hot spot for Vegas :)",4
2383,0,"I hate to give a bad review but we had a pretty paltry experience at Kabuki. We knew we wanted to try a new place for Sushi and instead of using Yelp reviews we used the convenience of Tempe Marketplace, big mistake. With all of the new Sushi places and good reviews on here I wish we wouldn't have wasted the time or money at Kabuki. \n\nWe sat at the bar and I wouldn't blame all of the bad experience on the bartender. There was one for the entire bar and for the entire restaurant (making all of the drinks for the servers as well). Therefore, it took a good 10 minutes of us sitting in front of him for him to ask us what we wanted to drink. We ordered 3 items about 30 minutes into being there. After being there for about an hour we received one item that we ordered then 10 minutes later received one more and one that we didn't order. We said we would just eat it but instead they put in for our original order and stored the Sushi in a fridge under the bar (whomever orders that roll next is not going to get it rolled fresh). \n\n\nThe good thing was that it wasn't terribly expensive. $6-$10 for a roll and I think around $8 or $9 for a Sake Bomb. It just took us close to two hours to eat at the bar and the food wasn't really that amazing. I hate giving bad reviews, maybe I will change it to 3....no I will leave it at 2. If we ever stop in again and it is better I will definitely raise my star rating.",0

He did not arrive until 9:45am.  My wife told him the issue that we were having.  He went to where the circuit breakers were and to the side of the circuit breaker there is an electrical outlet with a test and surge protector button.  He pressed the button and all was fixed.  The electrician was at my house not even 5 minutes.  He then proceeds to charge my family $150 for the 5 minutes of work.

We arrived to a restaurant that wasn't fully seated but was on a wait.  Once we were seated at our table, it took 30 minutes to get the bloody mary's that were ordered.  The food took another 30 minutes - so we ended up being at the restaurant from 10:40am until 1:00pm.  Kind of ridiculous for a restaurant that wasn't super busy on a Monday morning.",0

2392,0,"Ate here last night for dinner. Overall, this buffet was hit or miss, with a lot of misses.\n\nThe selection of food was on the small side, compared to most other buffets in town.  Most of the entrees were not very good.  Stand outs were the short ribs and chili chicken.  The do pasta extremely poorly.  We only managed to eat one bite of both the lasagne and the shrimp stuffed ravioli w/ pesto sauce.  If I hadn't ready the description of the dish I never would have known it was shrimp stuffed OR had a pesto sauce.  The filling was white and mushy with no taste.  The pesto sauce was dry and green.  \n\nThe vegetables and salads were outstanding!  It's really hard to believe.  There was mashed butternut squash that was at the very end of the buffet that was very very good.  It was next to made to order NY steak and had already been cooked.  Not sure where the \""made to order\"" came in.\n\nBroccoli, roasted vegetables, fish with mango sauce and five grain salad were also very good.  The Tuscan bread salad was awful. The turkey from the carving station was not good either.  Hard to believe that they could mess up vegetable pizza, but they did.  \n\nThe dessert bar had great chocolate flan, but not much else of note.\n\nThe service was not much better.  They promptly cleared dishes the moment you got up and they were very good about bringing fresh silverware/napkins, but they managed to spill water on us every time they refilled our glasses!  The iced tea was delicious.  \n\nI would spend my money and calories somewhere else!",1

2396,0,"My sister and I headed over here last week and I have to say, I was a little mixed about our visit.\n\nWhen we first walked in, there was no one there. Literally. We were eye'ing the ice creams for almost 5 minutes before the server drifted in from the Z Pizza side.\n\nI had the Pink Spot sundae with two ginormous scoops of kona coffee and hot fudge. The ice cream was meh, but the hot fudge was very good and served in generous portion. My sister had the low-fat coffee with ribbons of chocolate and she raved.\n\nThe prices weren't outrageous considering the serving size; just one week before I spent three dollars more for the same exact thing at Mary Coyle's.\n\nI wasn't overly impressed with the ice cream, but they get props for always having at least one low fat, sugar free, or sorbet offering.\n\nIt probably wouldn't be my first choice for ice cream, but because they are in the neighborhood they get a gold star for convenience!",0

Here is something I cringe to say and really isn't in my vocabulary; \""It's worth the wait\"".\n\nWe started with Oyster shooters.  They went down quickly while we watched the chef prepare our chowder and gumbo.  My Alaskan New England seafood chowder ($17.99) was full of large shrimp, lobster, and plentiful flaked snow crab along with heavy cream as a thickener rather than potatoes.  This simply could not have been better.\n\nMy wife had the Combo Pan Roast ($21.99) chocked full of shrimp, crab, and lobster in a creamed tomato base with brandy and a portion of rice.  Hard to believe but it had more seafood than she could eat!  Both items we had are meal sized.\n\nFood is cooked right at the counter using small portion sized steam jacketed kettles.  It's a gentle way to cook and very appropriate for the best quality seafood.  The cooking method makes for slow deliberate service but the time spent zooms by watching the cooking and with banter from the chef , server and customers.\n\nThis was one of the best meals we've ever eaten.  They have 15 to 20 counter seats only (this is not fine dining, just fine eating) and are open 24 hours a day.  Just another reason you gotta love Vegas.",3

After seeing the enticing commercials so many times, we decided to give this place a try on a double date. I understand the prices of the play cards and won't dispute them; however, the food was incredibly over-priced, came out COLD (as in, sat on a counter without warmers for a minimum of 30 minutes) and I literally had to ask the bartender if there was any vodka in my drink. It was pure juice. $38 for three shots that had little-no alcohol in them. (Not to mention, my glass was dirty, and I saw the bartender scoop the glass into the ice basin because she was too lazy to use the sanitary scoop. I know the Food and Beverage Commission would be as disappointed as I was.) The service was terrible. Don't ask for anything from your waiter, as they are a little too busy on their cell phones or conversing amongst themselves. \n\nWas it fun to be in an adult-themed arcade? Yes. If you're looking for a good atmosphere to go with friends to play games, I suppose I would advise you give it a shot. I would never recommend their food, customer service, or drinks. Save yourself the money and stay home, or go for a traditional bowling, figure skating, roller-blading, rock climbing, basically any other physically-entertaining themed date instead.",0

I wouldn't consider this a family hotel but good for us as a couple as we do not have young children.  The slick visuals and glass make this place interesting and classy.  We were disappointed that the one Italian restaurant we wanted to eat at here (and the main reason we stayed here this time) was closed for Thanksgiving week. Something to remember for future reservations - always check on the restaurants or stores that you want to visit first to see if they're open or still there...  Check-in and out was a breeze (the staff are extra nice). The only room complaint we have is that the water pipes in our room were extremely noisy all night (coming from other rooms as well!) and this was very disturbing and difficult.  Too bad, seems like the glitz is a facade for cutting corners on construction. Too bad.  We did like that the hotel has free and easy parking, although they get you with a high resort fee on top of the room rate (most Marriott Hotels do this - NOT NICE MARRIOTT!). But, at least this place didn't charge for parking too... The little coffee bar near reception is horrible and unhappy not nice people work there - and their coffee is nasty... the lady never acknowledged me and never said thank you or you're welcome even after I said it three times!

I had \""Mama's french toast breakfast\"". It should be called \""Mama's stuff you full because she knows damn well you ain't been eatin' right without her there platter\"". It came with 4 slices of sourdough french toast, 2 eggs, your choice of bacon or sausage (I chose sausage), and of course I had to order a small side of the hash brown casserole. Of course. I washed all the artery clogging goodness with a large OJ. YUM. Everything came out hot and fresh and with maple syrup. Real maple syrup, y'all! My lunch buddy had the country breakfast that came with eggs, bacon, biscuits and gravy, and grits! We were both so happy we were giggling like little kids in between bites of the great breakfast. For about the same price of another competitor's breakfast platter, we got a fresh baked, hot off the griddle and huge breakfast. I think we've decided that this is a favorite from now on! \n....or have we???",4

2432,0,"1 star, because there isn't a lower rating available. - \n\nWe were driving up from Scottsdale specificly to go to the Town Dump. We were on vacation from Indianapolis and wanted to go there to see if we could find a gift / souvenier for the mom of a young girl that was vacationing with us. We were half way there when we called  to see what time they close. The woman on the phone said 6 pm.  We explained we were from out of town and were in route at the time  of the call and it looked like we would be arriving a few minutes before 6pm. We asked if we got there before 6pm, would we still be able to shop. The woman said no, because they had a contract with an alarm company which required them to set the alarm exactly at 6pm. ( I find this hard to believe.)\n\nSince we were already half way there, we decided to see if maybe we could arrive fast enough for the woman to allow us the honor of shopping for junk in her store. We pulled into the lot at 10 till 6. I thought great, we can run thru the store real fast with Maddie to see if anything caught her eye. We jumped out of the car quickly and headed toward the door. The woman was outside and practically ran to beat us there. She grabbed the security gate and pulled it across the door shaking her head no. When I said , but it's 10 minutes before 6. She said in a snotty voice, \""it's 3 till and we have already set the code.\""  Even telling her we drove from Scottsdale specifically to go there, it did not sway her.\n\nIn summary, I know my watch was not off. I know we had 10 minutes. I would have been ok with her saying we had to leave at 6 or a minute before. The bottom line is, she was cold, heartless, uncaring, self centered, uncompationate and I will never go there again.",0

As appetizers we had the chicken flatbread which I highly recommend, the calamari, which was alright & the spicy edamame. As for sushi, I was not really impressed. We ordered the Las Vegas roll which was just OK; the spicy tuna, which was NOT even spicy & the tuna was a weird light pink color closer to salmon rather than the dark pink that I'm used to; the wave roll, which was pretty tasty; and the spider roll which was also just OK. I wish I had ordered a burger or something cuz I didn't really see what was so special about this place.

2435,0,"If you like being taken advantage of, go here- this could be your morning coffee run.. We were staying at the Cosmo and decided on our last day to give this coffee shop a try instead if walking across to the PH Starbucks. Tried to order 2 iced coffees with flavor, one with soy. Had to give the order THREE times to the woman behind the counter. Also got a blueberry muffin and a banana. The first time it was rung up, the total was $18. I handed her my money, when all of a sudden the total jumps to $26 (!). I questioned the mark-up and the on duty manager came over. She verified my order as iced coffees, I said yes, and yet it still got rung up as $26. I don't care how fancy, or expensive a hotel is- at some point it becomes price gauging and taking advantage of tourists. I told them to forget the order, I would go to Starbucks. Staff tried to tell me it would cost the same there (we actually laughed at that). Ordered the SAME thing at the 'bucks, came to TEN dollars less.

It had a nice smoke ring on most, but lacked the flavor needed.

2452,0,"I was so excited when I found out Yalla was opening near my house- we were in need of a good Med Cuisine place there, and also, it is owned by Khoury's- my FAVORITE place to eat.  \nWe ordered a few things, the roasted chicken sandwich, Fatoush salad with Chicken, and the beef kabobs. \nThe rice was out of this world! It has a little crispy thin noodles and a light oil.  The hummus was great and the Fatoush was so tasty.  My husband had no complaints about the sandwich..but we did have a couple downsides.  \nThe order was billed incorrectly.  And the cashier was very apologetic, but ended up billing me more, so that he didn't have to call his manager to fix it.  I felt that he should have just billed me the price he told me over the phone and comped his mistake.  Also, their Pita bread was not as good as i had hoped, tasted kind of old.  \nI'll be back though.\n\nUPDATE: \nI did come back, only to wait in line behind another customer for 10 minutes (at a counter btw) without so much as a \""hello\"", or \""sorry\"" from the cashier. The wait was so long becuase this woman could not get her order together and we were ignored so we just left. AWFUL SERVICE. Cashier should have acknowledged us, or offered to start our order while the customer ran out to her car, but no. Nothing. AWFUL! \nWe went to Osaka across the street.",2
2453,0,"Everything tastes alright, nothing stands out at this place.\n\nThis is the newest buffet in town (2010), new concept (Foods were presented in small 'Spoons').   However, the food quality itself and customer service still have lots areas that needs to be improved.\n\n1. Whoever directed us to cashiers needs to know when her fellow coworkers are going on lunch break. When you direct customers to a queue, you better know your cashier is not closing down the counter for her own break, or the result is the angry customers redirected line to another cashier while waiting behind the people whose originally behind you in line.\n\n2. Waiter/Customer ratio.  I feel bad for the staffs that work here. They have to carry alot of the heavy plates and I did witness some girl dropped the glass bottles (bye bye to part of her wage?).  I agree with other posters that we hardly get our plates removed.  It is easier to push our plates onto other people's table when they are gone than waiting for our waiter to remove them.   Our waiter forgot to bring some of our drinks during the first round, and we had to ask others to refill our drink because we just don't see him very often.  However, when we can grab someone to help, they were glad to help.\n\n3. Food availability.  I know this place is trying to be different.  They cut lunch at 3pm.  But the food seems to be disappear starting from 2:15pm.   They have a set quota of food that would be offered during lunch hours.  After the amount of food that's consumed., then it is gone.  For example, sushi (Cut rolls, hand rolls), crab cocktails were gone around early 2pm.  You just simply can't find the chef working at the sushi station no more after 2:15pm.  They just remove the plate completely.  The lady works at the crab stations were trying to find some crabs for me, but there's simply no more. (Yes this is a buffet but you are telling me, sorry, no more food - What a JOKE).  If you guys have set quota of food available, you should be better off a la carte instead of buffet.\n\n4. Food taste - Everything tastes very, very average, nothing Wowed me.  It is one of those places that you go in, you come out, and you don't remember what is good about it.   By the way, their Asian Station is bad, I highly recommend them to improve the taste of the food that they offer and they need to clean the counter more frequently.  I have seem that slice of Korean BBQ beef been hanging on the counter (instead of the plate/bowl where its suppose to belong) during the duration of my visit.\n\n5. Dessert tastes alright. Small dishes concept, their chocolate dipped strawberry are the highlight of the entire buffet.  Everything else tastes pretty average at best.\n\nSince this place is still NEW (opened less than 2 weeks). I give a 3* rating instead of the 1-2 star rating and as I would.  However, until further improvements have been made on service and food, I do not recommend nor I will go back to this buffet for the price and the \""Super luxury\"" buffet that they claimed themselve to be.",2

He was incredibly cool and patient which is pretty amazing considering how flooded this place gets with patrons after shows. All I wanted in the world was a blue cheese burger & they don't offer one. So, I (annoyingly I'm sure) chose a random burger off the menu and substituted all the toppings to make exactly what I wanted and the server didn't even blink. When I got my burger (quickly too!) it was just how I had ordered it, PLUS cooked correctly AND even remembered that I wanted onion rings instead of french fries.

2465,0,"We live in Litchfield Park, but took the trip to Scottsdale based on this place's reputation. The building and decor are super nice in a throwback Spanish mission sort of way. The separate \""tequilleria\"" and patio are attention getting. since it was 119 degrees, we sat inside. \n\nThat is where the fun ended. \n\nWe ordered chips and salsa for $5. No big deal, but where else do you pay for that in any sit down joints anymore? They do bring out fresh tortillas, gratis, but we didn't know that and it's not mentioned on the menu.\n\nThe menu is pretty limited and oh so pricey. $15.00 for two a la cart tacos. Holey Moley, they better be stuffed with caviar. There is no taco on the planet worth $7.50 (maybe worth $7 :-)) and I have had some great tacos. These are not those tacos.\n\nThe fish tacos were under seasoned portions of Mahi Mahi. The fish itself was not seasoned at all and actually had a fishy taste. Not pleasant. It was served with radishes rather than coleslaw which was interesting and the crema which was tasty. But as a whole, it was bland and underwhelming even after adding the accompanying sauce.\n\nWe also had the bacon wrapped spicy meatloaf on garlic mashed potatoes. Served with a zippy red pepper sauce and tree trunk sized asparagus. The sauce was very tasty, the meatloaf was tender and not  dry. There was something so rich in the meatloaf itself, that after 3/4 of one slice, I couldn't eat anymore of it. It just began to turn my stomach. The potatoes were cooked really well and had some nice flavor, but needed salt. That was funny, because there was no salt on the table. The asparagus was well cooked and still had some snap, but like the potatoes, it was under seasoned.\n\nWe ordered the banana stuffed fried tortilla in blackberry reduction and were disappointed there too. The tortillas were overstuffed with banana, so that you couldn't enjoy the crunchy texture of the cinnamon crusted tortilla. It just became mush. The reduction was not \""reduced\"" and was runny, but tasty. \n\nFor three of us, the tab totaled over $85 before tip. That included 2 bud lights, which WERE cold and refreshing. \n\nAll said, the environment is far more interesting than the food. The place's reputation is undeserved at half the price!",0

2473,0,Hands down so far the best cheap eats pizza I have had in Pittsburgh. Big slices and the ones I have had (usually with garlic) have been loaded with lots of flavor. One is more than enough for me. Not particularly greasy like you would think for a pizza join and just oh so tasty. The crust is crisp and I like how after you make your pizza selection they warm it up in the oven. I haven't had anything else on their menu except for side salads with balsamic dressing (weird consistency initially though fine after mixing around) though I am very tempted to try their wings. Another perk is that they are opened late.,3
2474,0,"My primary care physician here in Phoenix referred me to AZ Advanced Dermatology on Highland in Phoenix for an evaluation of several suspect moles and other skin markings several years ago.   That visit with Dr Machnau was unremarkable.   I had quite a bit of sun damage on my skin in my youth so I figured I should be checked every few years and just had another appointment with Dr Machnau this past week.  I have to say it was the shortest appointment I've ever had with an MD in my life (I'm 55 years old).    The doctor arrived in the examining room and I swear she was in and out of there in 3 minutes.   She VERY rapidly examined my face, scalp, shoulders, back, chest, legs, and feet.   There was precious little interaction or communication with me.   I have to say that it's seems hard for me to believe that a skilled physician could so quickly perform a careful inspection of an entire body.   The visit certainly did not inspire confidence that every spot and lesion was evaluated.   I will certainly make arrangements to see another dermatologist the next time I get checked.",0
2475,0,The food was ok but the reason this place received one star was because the customer service was by far the worst ever.

2488,0,"We hired this company in the summer of 2013. They had a great website and the owner, Jason, had a very dynamic personality said he was an 'Enrolled Agent with the IRS, etc. Seemed good. \n\nMy first clue should have been they were more concerned about getting their first check, than they were about the information needed to create the bookkeeping and tax files. Months would go by without hearing from them and when you'd send an email, there would be no response. When you called, they would say there was an 'email problem' and to send it to a different email address. Then there was always an excuse for not replying; \""I'm traveling.\"", \""I'm not in the office\"", \""I'll have ____ check on it\"", etc.\n\nTax times rolls around and the owner brags, \""All businesses wait until October to file their taxes, I've already put yours on an extension.\""  Great! Then I got calls from my folks that said they hadn't received their 1099's. The office couldn't find the information, so I resent. I gave them numerous documents to work on bookkeeping, and nothing ever got put in place.\n\nFinally, I called the IRS and asked if an extension had been filed? The answer? No, but we see someone TRIED to file an extension on June 17th.  Of course, when I called Total Business Solutions, Jason was 'traveling', but would get back to me the following week. I went into the office and asked for my tax documents. They handed me the same envelope I had given them and not one single letter or document with tax information had been opened.\n\nThe bottom line? I paid this company more than $3000 in less than 12 months and never received one item of work in return. IRS 1099's not filed, personal and business taxes not filed, no bookkeeping, no receivables/expenditures, nada. But they did deduct their monthly fee.\n\nI have subsequently found out there are several others with this experience.  Be very careful about hiring this business. If you do hire them, make sure you keep copies of all communication because chances are, you'll need it later for Court.",0

2490,0,"Mister Steer is a Montreal institution. Once voted to have the best burgers in Montreal . The interior has a dated 70's diner feel to it. \n\nOnce you are seated - be prepared to get a green salad. There's no way to say no to it. The waitress will serve it to you immediately (I see the salad as a good introduction to the grease that's about to come...) and you have only 1 choice of dressing: French (never asked if you can have ranch..)\n\nMr. Steer is known for their ball burgers. What I mean by this is that the meat is not shaped into a flat patty - but rather a ball. It cooks nice and evenly on the outside. The only way to order a burger here is medium - anything else and you are loosing out on the flavour. \n\nAnother great item here are the Suzie Q fries.

2492,0,"It's not been half an hour since I walked out of Haweli and I'm on Yelp writing this review. I hope that is as good an understatement as I can make as to how TERRIFIC this restaurant is. Where do I start??? The ambiance, the service, the food..!!! I'm at a loss!!!\n\nIt is my son's second birthday today and my family and I being new to AZ did not have anyone to celebrate it with. So we decided to walk down to Haweli (it helps that we live right behind the restaurant) and treat ourselves to a quiet dinner. In hindsight, that has to be the best decision we've taken today.\n\nWe walked in and were immediately greeted by Gopi (he's one of the two guys who run this place). We chose our own seats and Gopi got us the toddler seat for our son. The place was tastefully done with grand chandeliers, ample lighting and great decor We were given water (even that tasted awesome) and they were very understanding when we asked for a little more than the usual time in placing the order since we had to get our son settled first. We ordered the masala pappad, chicken pakora, garlic naan, tandoori shrimp masala and chicken biriyani. We loved the pakora which was basically succulent tandoori chicken covered with the traditional pakora wrap. It came with the mint and sweet and sour chutneys which were superb as well. The garlic naan was just perfect and the shrimp masala was out of this world. The gravy was thick and savory while the shrimp was marinated and cooked to perfection. My wife thought the chicken biriyani was great, however she found it to be different from the Kerala flavored chicken biriyani that we are more used to. Nevertheless, she really liked it.\n\nDespite there being no complimentary rice with curries, we were given a full portion of rice at no cost. But the icing on the cake was yet to come. When Gopi got to know that it was my son's birthday, he got us three huge fantabulous Mango lassies \""on the house\""!!! All portions of food were easily sufficient for 2 pax. If you are used to Indian food, a spice index of 7/10 should be just fine. (We could've gone for 8 but then wanted to keep it a little mild for our toddler). The wait time was just a little over 10-12 mins which I thought was very reasonable. \n\nFinally, a word on the \""people\"". When the lady waitressing on you has seen more of India than you have managed in your entire existence, you know you are in good hands. Marissa was not just knowledgeable about the menu, but she also was seen helping out guests unfamiliar to Indian cuisine what to choose. She was super friendly and courteous. Gopi and Pradeep both individually walked up to us during various times and checked if we were ok and made it a point to talk to us while we were leaving. They have plans to expand the menu with more south Indian varieties such as Dosa, vada etc. being introduced. I can only imagine myself queuing up by the Haweli every morning in a little while to start off my day with authentic south Indian cuisine.\n\nWhile the signature of every restaurant is the quality of the food that is served, for me, the team that gets you the food (right from your table to the kitchen and back) are the ones who leave an indelible mark on you.  I have been overwhelmed by the warmth and care shown by the staff. They were constantly looking for feedback from us on how to improve the menu, food, service and presentation. To me, that is the hallmark of a restaurant that looks set to be doing excellent business in times to come!!!\n\n***\nThe price is VERY reasonable for the quantities and quality that they offer. And they are running a 15% off on all meals until end of July.",4

The pool is a little murky and the pool staff does not do a good job of cleaning up after it's guests (i.e. throwing away bottles and plastic cups laying around the pools and the lounge chairs etc.).\n\nHere are some tips for future guests:\n\n1. If you are going to stay in this hotel, please be sure you request to stay in the Impanema building, which is the older/original hotel.  Unlike the the rooms in the newer building, these rooms have been renovated within the past 10 years, cleaner and more modern and well kept.  They are pretty spacious too!\n2. It is better to self park than to use the valet as their valet can be a little slow at times.\n3.  Stay away from the All American Bar and Grille inside the hotel.

We were promptly seated by the fountain.\n\nI should say that service is fantastic! \n\nThe waiter provided a bucket of some kind of 'bread' which none of us liked but I was too hungry to argue. I'm a firm believer that you can judge a restaurant on it's bread. And Trevi was failing early on.\n\nMy wife ordered the salmon, my daughter ordered spaghetti (sauce on the side) and I Veal parm.\n\nI'll start with the great - My Veal was exceptional - nearly every time I've had Veal Parm at a restaurant it has been underwhelming at best and like cardboard at worst.  Trevi's was simply amazing.  They should make this a signature dish. Kudos to the Chef.\n\nOur daughter loved her spaghetti - however it came out wrong at first and had to be remade.\n\nMy wife's salmon was 'average'. It was cooked properly but lacked any flavor. And it was on a bed of black crunchy something. She fished all the salmon pieces she could off the plate and left everything else.\n\nDessert menu was passed around and surprisingly our daughter passed on it. If a seven year old passes on sugar, something is wrong with the options. So we asked for the check and left.\n\nWhat I discovered later is what left 'the bad taste in my mouth'.

If you are extremely sodium deficient this is your buffet. If you like carved meats that make you wish for a meat tenderizer to beat them with this is your buffet. If you like semi-frozen out of the box desserts this is definitely your buffet. Go slow on your drinks as getting a server to refill it is next to impossible. When you walk in there are Zagat rated signs on the wall, with all due respect this place isn't worthy of being rated by Zagat.

2508,0,"My extreme dislike of Wetherspoons pubs does not mean that I am able to avoid them altogether, seeing as every man and his dog thinks the 'Spoons is a good place to meet, booze, eat and generally make merry. Why?! I have to go to these kinds of places occasionally; it is rarely an enjoyable experience and this place is no exception. \n\nThis chain clone has everything you'd expect from a Wetherspoons; tables full of sauce packets, cheap booze on tap, puggies in the corner and no music (thankfully) so you can actually have some kind of conversation without screaming down each others ear holes (the only bonus). \n\nOn my visit to the Graham Bell (Alexander would turn in his grave!) it was steak night. A bargainous \u00a37.50 odd for an eight oz steak, sides and a beer. I figured this was probably the safest bet and opted for the sirloin with jacket potato, peas, mushrooms and tomato. My mates ordered separately from me but also went the steak route. \n\nOf course, because we ordered 30 seconds apart from each other, my meal was served half an hour earlier than theirs. I was finished before the rest of the grub arrived.

The inn takes up an entire beautifully-restored brick Victorian-era house, and also the carriage house in back.\n\nA really nice man named Ed runs the Parador, together with his cute Black Lab, Razor.

The entire interior has been completely renovated, but with furnishings and other decorations that remain in keeping with the Victorian style of the building.  The guest rooms are not rooms, but huge, luxurious suites (the smallest of the guest rooms is a 328-square-foot room - bigger than many studio apartments), and the common areas are welcoming and comfortable.  This B&B has the typical amenities (in-room TV, phone, coffee maker, full American-style breakfast each morning, wireless access, hair dryers and laundry stuff, little fridges) with some bonuses you don't always see (the decanter of port on top of the piano in one of the common rooms, the giant full private bath in each of the rooms, a conservatory room).  There is no gym in the house itself, but you can get a free pass to the Allegheny YMCA (only about three blocks away, and a pretty great institution in its own right).\n\nPrices to stay here are shockingly low at $150/night.  This is the same price you would pay to stay at a chain hotel, getting a fraction of the space and none of the individualized attention, impeccable hospitality, or unique style you will find here.\n\nYou should stay here if you're coming in from out of town.  I fully intend to stay here if I ever feel inclined towards a miniature romantic getaway or something.  It's a pretty great spot.",2

2517,0,"I have to give Burger 21 only two stars for a couple of reasons. First, service. Despite there being at least 15 staff members, service was slow. My friends order came out 11 minutes before mine did. The owner clearly saw that we had been waiting a while for the second burger, but he just asked a staff member to check on it rather than find out himself. It wasn't busy as we went around 1:30 pm. Second reason I am disappointed was I ordered my burger without cheese. When my order finally came out, it was clear they scraped off the cheese. I could still see melted cheese on it that had been wiped off. It could have been they reused the same bun and toppings and made a new burger patty, hence the long wait...but either way there was cheese on part of it, then wiped off. I did inform the owner who apologized and gave me a $5 off coupon for my next visit. For a burger that was $8 without fries, this was somewhat insulting especially after he informed me the cook made a new burger. Either I was lying or he was. They offered to make me a new one but I wasn't wanting to wait another 15 minutes. After all was said and done, I ate less than about half the burger as it was very soggy and I was ready to just leave. The $5 coupon isn't enough incentive to get me to try it again. That's a shame as I was hoping it would be a great neighborhood joint like Fired Pie next door is.",1

Yes, there are noise issues, a less than ideal parking situation on some nights, and higher rent ...BUT, the reason I continue to call this place home is because it is so inspiring, rich and pleasing to the eyes to view and is straight up BEAUTIFUL!  I have met many good friends from this complex and expanded my contact list and network by living here.  I gave this review 4 stars because even though Optima is a beautiful place to live, there are a few things that make it just under 5 STAR.  Having said that, if you are looking to rent or purchase a condo or APT then this is the first place you better check out.  Everyone must live here for at least a year to understand the true beauty of the Optima.

2522,0,"My wife and I had been semi-regular customers until recently.  I went in on a weekday morning with my normal, small back-pack (less than 225 cubic inches, too small to hold a standard 8.5x11\"" notepad) which contains sunglasses, car keys, wallet, epipen, first aid kit and a few other small items.  Upon entering the store I was asked to have the bag checked.  I've been in the store numerous times with the same bag and never had a problem.  I see many women go into the store with purses much larger than my bag and they never get asked to have their bag checked.\n\nMy issue is that if you are going to treat your customers like criminals, you need to be consistent about it or post a sign stating that bags may be subject to being checked.  I can understand wanting to check large backpacks and if the security policy was consistently followed and lowering prices, I could accept it.  However the prices in the store are generally 10-20% higher than nearly any other place I've gone.  Until now I've been willing to pay the premium for the convenience and selection.\n\nAlso submitted feedback via their corporate website but have yet to hear back.  So much for customer service and treating the customer well.  We will not be going back to Gander Mountain.  There are other local shops that can supply my firearms.",0

2527,0,"Can't say anything bad about this please, and believe me I've reviewed some bad places before. I love 910 LIVE. \n\nI am a local concert photographer and shot A LOT. When I'm hired for a show at this venue I jump at the opportunity. \n\nIf you didn't know it was there, you'd probably miss it. But get off McClintock at 202 and headed a 1/4 mile north. It's on your left at the corner. The front is unassuming and mostly you'll end up going in the side door. This side door opens to the rear of the venue that is absolutely huge. It's essentially a concrete slab in the back with those hugh 10' tall shipping containers stacked on top of each other to make back walls. It's very cool. There is elevated seating all along one side where if you stand or sit you can see over the center floor crowd to the large stage. One of of this area has a bar that opens onto the back of the actual building. Beers are absolutely reasonable and they carry domestic and all local craft brews, too. Their whiskey is in line with many Tempe haunts (not the over expensive Scottsdale prices).\n\nI mentioned the stage because it's great. As a photographer I've been to some stages where the lights are so bad it is tough to even begin to shoot a show, but both the lighting and sound here are top notch. There is a large rigging that goes about 20' up behind and above the front of the stage so lighting is not an issue. The guy who runs sound here (may even own the place, he's white and bald) is an absolute perfectionist when it comes to his audio. It's always great.\n\nSometimes between bands on large shows, they do floor shows. They once had this art group of women with metals plates attached to bikinis, they danced around, and had metal grinders shoot sparks off their bodies. You are definitely in for a treat at 910 Live. \n\nI mentioned the outside stage, but there's also an inside stage. The two stages back up to one another so they can open this large garage door and move equipment between the two stages quickly. While the inside stage is much smaller, the lights are still good, and it's intimate. I've seen the inside totally packed and everyone loved the show. They just danced together as a big unit and enjoyed the show.\n\nBouncers are great and don't give me hassle when I need to move behind the rope to get side stage shots or even shots from behind the bands. They've always been accommodating and friendly, but they also run a tight ship and I've never seen anyone get unruly at this place. For the bands, they also have a \""green room\"" which is a green trailer that sits off to the side of the stage. Inside is a bank of theatre mirrors and a prep table, comfy couches and chairs, and a private bathroom with shower. Good area and good times completely at this venue.",4

The fresh fruit on the buffet consisted of sections of red grapefruit and oranges.  There were no fresh veggies, no multigrain anything, no pasta salads, nothing at all interesting or healthy.

The quality was good and the service was prompt and friendly.\n\nThe second time we went we were put in the far corner, probably as far away from the sushi bar as you can get. The quality was still there but the service was terrible. We felt forgotten being so far away and it took a long time to get our first order.

It was decent but nothing to get excited about so whoever wrote the menu is just really good about describing things in a fanciful way. \n\nNow the chicken tenders. I heard the waitress telling someone else that they were so popular they made an adult version. I love chicken tenders so I ordered them. It was like cardboard microwaved chicken. Took 2 bites and sent it back. I was in shock. Chicken tenders are usually so good to me because of the different ways that restaurants bread and fry em up. The tots were like what you get at elementary school lunch. I'm sorry union but for kids maybe okay, the only adults who would eat that are ones who are too drunk to notice what you just put in front of them. \n\nLocation and decor is great. Figure out your kitchen timing, revisit some of the menu items and this place could be really successful.",0

My husband and I ate here last night and,  my husband who is a \""hamburger aficionado\"", was very impressed, as well as myself.  Joey, our server, was great and knew the menu and was able to answer all our questions very professionally.  We built our own burgers and they were delicious.  We ordered a side of onion rings...they were so good we ordered a second one. By the way,  the burgers were delivered with a side of slaw, which was not your usual run of the mill, but very good with a twist...a little bit of spice.  We didn't have room for dessert, but they have a great dessert menu...so check it out.  We only live less than ten minutes away, so having this in our neighborhood is a plus.",3
2565,0,HORRIBLE customer service. My sister and I went there after having no success at finding a brides maid dress from David's Bridal. No one greeted us. After browsing for 10 minutes I finally had to find someone to help us. I told her what we were looking for and she just brushed us off. It was a terrible experience. That alone caused them to lose our business. They get 2 stars because the dresses were beautiful and they had a decent amount of accessories to chose from. I would never suggest this place to anyone.,0
2566,0,"Terrible service!!!!  Food was ok, but don't think we will be back.  They left a empty dirty salad bowl on our table for more than half an hour, gross!  Many servers and managers walked by with no notice of dirty dishes on tables,  we had to box up our own food,  and at no time did anyone offer me a second glass of wine!  Fail!!!  They also sat two well dressed adults in the kiddie section, really?!?!  It was not busy, early in the evening, and a full staff.  There is no excuse for such terrible service!  I wish I had  read the other reviews before we ate here.   After all these bad reviews you would think their corporate would get a clue or they just don't care either!   Lazy and apathetic is no way to go through life.",0
2567,0,"I like the Sands properties since their shows are constantly rotating, bringing something new. The people who produced the Beijing Olympic ceremonies also produced Panda ! So the basic story is Long Long is on a journey to save his Peacock Princess from the Demon Vulture who kidnapped her on their wedding day. \n\nIt's got a little bit of everything: stunts like balancing on stilts, acrobatics, kung fu board breaking and sword work and traditional Chinese dances from the long sleeve dance to some fan dancing. I think the costuming was done very nicely and the stage was nicely used. The one thing is the whole back wall is used to project various landscapes and since there are steps and such in the back in certain angles the projection didn't look like it lined up right. The musical score I think was welldone and made sense with the story, though it would have been lovely to see more live music since Chinese culture has such awesome traditional drumming and unique instruments like the huqin Overall though it was lively and pretty show. \n\nThey try to interact and make it fun for the audience. Before the show you can find the pandas wandering around the lobby for pictures. During the show, they've thrown out various trinkets, pulled little kids to dance in the aisles with them, throw streamers onto some people, had big panda beach balls being thrown about during a staging transition. Between the theme, the bright staging and the audience interaction I would say this would be a good family friendly show choice. It seemed like there was a high number of children watching and seemed to really be enjoying themselves. \n\nNow I know that the main draw IS the panda characters, but I feel mixed about that. So the pandas are the only ones in full on fuzzy animal suits and other animals are more people with wardrobe that was made to interpret a animal. So there were moments where it's supposed to be sad or tense and I just couldn't muster up the feels for him since the panda was such a caricature of himself. He's supposed to be shaking in sadness and crying when he lost princess peccock, but his big head is just bobbing in a way that was funny and not helping the cause. In the picture I posted of the show, you'll see how it's a serious scene with everyone else on stage and then....there's a kawaii little panda in a suit and top hat. \n\nAnd of course, the story line sounds a little stolen from Kung Fu Panda. I absolutely loved Po, but the animation and the fact everyone else is animated made that more congruous. I'm sure it's a love/hate thing and some people may absolutely adore the fact it's a panda and part of the point is that it's fun/funny. \n\nOverall, I still enjoyed the show and appreciated the variety and a different culture it brings to the Vegas show lineup. Definitely if you are a parent, this would make a great family night. Or if you are a rice chaser, as I saw a lot of those there too.",0

Honestly, if my girlfriend hadn't recommended it I'd never have come here. \n\nThe sushi's pretty decent. They have a neat concept where they have a roll for every state. We go there for girl's nights, so we all pick a few rolls and devour them together. The rolls are nice- nothing amazing, but good enough! The nigiri is a bit better. I split the hamachi with a girlfriend the last time, and that was pretty darn decent.\n\nThe drinks here are great. We always go and get the apple saketini. They pack a punch and taste delicious, and the price tag is very reasonable. My girlfriend is a regular though, and I think because of that we get taken care of very well. The server Jade is a hoot, expect to be sassed and taken care of all at the same time! She's great.\n\nOverall this is a nice place. Decent, with pretty good food and drinks.

2576,0,"Today is Administrative Assistant's Day, YAY, so our school's parent club took us all out to lunch here.  There were about 20 ladies all together and we arrived pretty much the second they opened.  They had a table all set up for us and ready to go.  We were immediately brought chips and salsa.\n\nThe chips were very plain, but I kept eating them.  Our bowls of chips were never empty.  We only had one girl taking care of our whole table, but after a couple rounds of refilled sodas she seemed to be getting the hang of it.  We kept her pretty busy but she handled it well.  The kitchen however, had a little difficulty and there was about a 15 minute difference between the time the first person was served and the last person.  Oh well, we all got our food and it was all correct.\n\nI ordered the cheese enchilada and chimichanga (a mini one) combination plate.  The beans that came with the dish were sprinkled with cheese and very tasty.  They were surprisingly smooth and buttery, I'm not really picky about the beans.  The enchilada was a big fat disappointment to me because there were onions inside.  I thought it would just have cheese, because everywhere else I have gone and gotten a cheese enchilada it was just plain inside.  The chimichanga was actually really good to my picky palate.  The shredded beef was flavorful and juicy.  It was also covered in cheese, and that is always a good thing in book.  I could also do without the shredded lettuce on my plate.  I'm not sure what purpose it served.\n\nOverall, it was a pretty decent experience.

The meal deals are huge so it's best to come here with more than two people just sayin.\n\n I think every meal I saw had Beef Tongue in it. I was more than prepared just to set it aside and not eat it. I'm always pestering  my husband to try something new so he turned the tables on me about trying the tongue.  I had to bite my tongue and literally eat one. He kept cooking it for me and I was getting nauseous. The tongue didn't taste bad it tasted like beef but I couldn't help but picture a big tongue with taste buds. My mom would always take me to the market with her and I would see this huge tongue in the meat case. It would gross me out and scare me! That was why I couldn't fully enjoy this experience. \n\nEven though I did dwell on eating a beef tongue for the first time there were other items that came with our meal which was delicious! It came with Kalbi (my favorite), Kobe beef, Chicken ( I let my husband eat all of that), Shrimp. It also came with salad, Miso Soup ,  rice, Kim Chee , Kim Chee radishes, spicy crab rolls , and spicy Tuna rolls. It was more than enough for two people! I enjoyed the coziness of the booth because you have your privacy so you can talk freely. My husband really enjoyed their ice cold beer. I wish they could do that with soda for the non beer drinker.

2581,0,"Last night was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had at a nice place like this. \n\nSteak and lobster. \nFillet rare when ordered medium. \nLobster was barely warm and bland. \nThe service was less than expected too. \n\nWhen I asked for some assistance with my undercooked food the server said it was rare not even med-rare let alone the medium I ordered and took it back. \n\nThey brought back the same cut up piece of meat that we dissected together at the table to confirm it was undercooked before we sent it back to the kitchen. \n\nWhere am I at Sizzler or a fine dining restaurant? \n\nIt gets better. After complaining about serving me scraps the manager asked if I would like a whole new steak. I told her yes, the first time maybe but not after 20 minutes of this! \n\nAt this point the lobster is gone the sides are almost gone and I didn't come here and order steak and lobster to be forced to eat one item at a time. \n\nBring a new plate all together the way I ordered it. Remember this wasn't even close. Two stages off on your cooking temperatures. The center was slightly warm or even room temperature you blew it!\n\nI opted to just cancel the steak. My son was done eating and as mentioned most of my other dishes were finished also. \n\nThen the bill came and they charged me for the sauce that I was not able to eat because I had no steak! Now this morning I noticed they have charged me full price for a lobster dinner vs. the add on price of 39.00 for lobster to be added to any meal as the menu clearly states. \nHence steak AND lobster. \n\nMy wife and I enjoyed this place several years ago and enjoyed it so much we dined their two nights in a row. \n\nObviously chef Kenneth Fazel was either not running this place at that time or if he was in fact the chef during our previous visits he must have recently taken up Smoking crack because it was a night and day difference from previous experiences. \nEither this guy doesn't deserve to be at these type's of establishments or he needs to clean house and start over!!!!\n\nI'm not talking about just blowing it on a steak.

2592,0,"I started my search for a French Bulldog and had decided between two breeders, one that was closer to home but the price was a little too unbelievable, and this woman. When I called her for information, she told me that all her dogs were AKC certified, weren't imported, and that if I chose to buy a dog from her, I would be able to contact her about the puppy I choose and would be able to get pictures and videos.\n\nAfter hearing that, I chose her. My mistake. I put down the deposit on Feb. 19, 2011 and right after that, she started flaking. I would call and she wouldn't answer, and if she did she would say she's too busy to talk. I would e-mail her and ask for photos or videos, and it would take her two weeks to send anything back. She would only send anything at all because I felt like I had to force her into it. When the photos finally came into my inbox is when I noticed something strange.\n\nThe dog in the pictures was the same one that she had posted on her website, one from a past litter. I didn't say anything, because I thought maybe I as being paranoid, until I saw that she had erased the original pictures off of her website. When I found that, I looked at the pictures she sent closer and found that it was a boy, not the little girl I had chose. When I confronted her about it, she said she sent the wrong photos by accident, but all the photos I got after that were still of the same dog.\n\nAt the time, I was making payments to her while the puppy was growing up, and I had never missed or was late with a payment, and it seemed like every time I would send a payment, she would get more and more distant. By the time it came to taking the trip to pick up my puppy, I had to call multiple times in order to arrange my pick up. Instead of picking up my puppy at her house, like she had originally promised, we had to meet her at her vet's office where one of her dogs was supposedly giving birth.\n\nI agreed, but only because I wanted to meet my little pup so bad. So when I made my long journey and finally met her, I did fall in love instantly with the puppy. My problem, Kristen was supposed to bring her AKC papers with her so I could register them. She told me that she would send them to me once I signed the contract, then she got in her car and drove away, even though she had said that she had one of her dogs giving birth inside.\n\n So when I brought her home, I took her to our vet to get a wellness check-up and they said everything was fine, so I sent the contract to Kristen so that I could get her AKC papers. A few days later, my puppy started not acting right. She wouldn't eat after a while, was lethargic and had really runny stool. So I took her to the vet again with a stool sample, I found out she had Giardia and Coccidia. To be fair, she warned me that she may have it, but it wouldn't be that serious. Well it was pretty serious.\n\nMy vet had to give her sub-q fluids before she left and started her on medicine and I had to buy special cleaner to clean up after her stools, since normal cleaners wont kill Giardia. When I contacted Kristen about this, she got really short with me and told me that it wasn't serious at all, despite what my own vet told me, and that she would send me medicine for it. She never sent it. I called her again, because by this time, it had been 4 weeks since I sent the contract to her, but I still hadn't received my AKC papers.\n\nShe told us that her assistant, whom I had never met nor heard of before, must have forgotten to send them and that she would send them out as soon as possible. It was another 4 weeks later and still nothing. When I tried to call again, she wouldn't answer. When I tried to e-mail, she wouldn't respond. So finally, I called AKC myself to ask about it. They had no record of my puppy being born, so her litter wasn't registered. My puppy cost $2400 so that it would be included with AKC, but she isn't.\n\nSo even now I still try to contact her, but she still won't give me the time of day, Find another breeder.",0

2598,0,"One of my roommates was extolling the beauty of Bosa.  I asked if they were as good as Rainbow, but she had never tried Rainbow.\n\nSo - we decided to do a taste test.  Three of us in the house - so we would get 3 different (but like) donuts from each.  The plan was to bring them back home, cut to sample size, and note flavor, texture and overall preference.\n\nThe guy roommate's favorite is glazed raised.  The gal leans to sugar raised and I figured glazed old fashioned is a safe baseline for taste testing.\n\nWe went to Rainbow first.  No problem getting the donuts we wanted.  I also picked up a half dozen donut holes.  Was not thrilled to be charged $0.50 for the box, but c'est la vie.  Girl roommate also got a watermelon frappe type of drink.  A bit sweet for my tastes, but very, very watermelony.\n\nNext stop Bosa.  They didn't have regular sugar raised - used powdered sugar instead.  (I have a hard time trusting that the regular sugar didn't stick - somehow they managed to make it work at Rainbow!)  So the granulated vs. powdered sugar raised would not be as scientific a comparison, but we'd make do.  No problem with the glzed and old fashioned.  We also picked up ham and swiss croissants.  One can never have too much pastry, right? :)\n\nResults - \n     Glazed raised - Bosa was slightly denser and chewier - more mouth satisfaction.  Rainbow was cloudlike fluffy and light.  Great texture, but we didn't feel satisfied from chewing.  Rainbow was slightly sweeter.\n          ~Votes - 3 for Bosa.~\n     Old Fashioned - textures were identical.  Rainbow had a slight lemon (or maybe aspatrame?) flavor in the back end of the tasting.\n          ~Votes - 1 slight lean to Bosa, 2 Draw~\n     Sugar raised - texture of donut was identical to glazed raised above.  (duh - same donut, different topping.)  The gal roomie likes granulated.  The guy roomie preferred the powdered.  I liked both.\n          ~Votes - 1 Bosa, 1 Rainbow, 1 Draw.\n\nSo, Bosa comes out with a slight edge.  And we came out with a slight sugar rush.

2599,0,"The food is all right. I can't say I'm an expert when it comes to Indian food, but I feel like the food is on par with the other Indian restaurants I've been to. I did have their buffet once and a lot of the foods were too salty. I usually go on Tuesdays though, when their main entrees are half off, but it really isn't as good a deal as it sounds. The portions are smaller than at other restaurants, so you're getting what you pay for.  \nThe service the last time I went was ATROCIOUS. The waiter filled half our water glasses & ran out of water in the pitcher, but it took him forever to come back to fill the rest of our glasses. It took him a while to take our order, too, but the restaurant was busy so I'll forgive him for that. While we were ordering, he asked us, \""what kind of bread would you like?\"" as if it were included in the meal, but be warned--it isn't! We were aware of this and ordered naan anyway, but be aware that it isn't half off. Throughout the meal, we had to keep reminding him to refill our waters and when my friend wanted to place an order for our other friend who was showing up late, the waiter asked him to wait for a moment and never came back. We had to flag him down to get the order in. Later, I asked for a take-out box and while my friends were finishing their dinners, I sat there balancing my box on the edge of the table because the table was so full (what's with their gigantic serving platters anyway? Such a waste of space for so little food!) The waiter came by a few times and never thought to clear the table of the empty plates. I feel like these are just basic waiting skills that everyone should know. We also had to wait forever to get the check.

2602,0,"Wow. I've enjoyed @TheVigAZ Uptown on all my previous visits.\n\nMy most recent experience could rightly be called the opposite of everything before.\n\nI am recently single. I decided yesterday to get out of the house to get out of my funk.\n\nI did something I really never do; I went out, alone.\n\nI don't really like to go out into social situations alone, for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that I think society tends to treat individuals who are in a social setting as pariahs.\n\nThe servers at The Vig Uptown hammered home how much that notion of being a pariah is true.\n\nI went out onto the back patio area, and sat down.\n\nThere were two or three other tables with people out there, and the inside wasn't packed.\n\nI watched as one server fawned over one particular table, but failed to even acknowledge my presence.\n\nMy irritation increased when a couple new people arrived, and joined the group already at that table. They then relocated to the seating around the fire pit.\n\nThe server was quick to attend to the new arrivals, and even enlisted the assistance of another server in getting all fresh glasses of water for everyone.\n\nAnd yet, I sat.\n\nThere were two other servers that were attending to the other tables, but neither of them seemed to notice my presence, either.\n\nI sat for just over 20 minutes with nary a nod of the head, much less a glass of water, or a drink order. Sad, because I was looking forward to trying the orange kreamsicle.\n\nI decided my singular presence was not welcome.\n\nAs I exited the building, I informed the young lady at the front that I had waited 20 minutes without so much as a visit to ask if I wanted to order anything.\n\nI suppose one might argue that I could merely have flagged someone down, rather than come home and write an angry tirade on Yelp.\n\nBut no, it is not my obligation as your customer to be seen, it is entirely your obligation, as a service-based business, to be attentive of your customers, and serve their needs.\n\nOn this day, you fell flat on your face.\n\nI don't know if that has pushed me to the point I will not return, but I definitely have some animosity over this experience.",0

2604,0,I find the lounge very classy and modern but the dance area is very small. Private/party areas are available for birthdays and events and it overlooks the dance floor.

2605,0,"D.I. animal hospital is one of the oldest clinics in town. Dennis Arn  has been my pets doctor for over 25 years. I am writing this review because of the extraordinary connection he has with all animals. I recently had to put down my 20 year old cat. She was a sweet child, very shy and scared easily. Dennis was the only person I could even think of handling this. He took her and promised me he would not let her go until it was over. She went down feeling comfort and love. Who could ask for a better exit than that. He is the ultimate animal whisperer. He has a gift, anyone that loves their pet should have a doctor like that. It eases your mind. You know the care will be about your pet and nothing else. He is still the same Dennis after 25 years, he puts the animals first always.\nThank you,\nNeva Marina",4

2607,0,"I foolishly lived at San Simeon for nearly 3 years. At first, the apartment I was in seemed decent because it was my first apartment ever! After our 13 month lease was up, I moved into an upgraded unit near the water. At first, it seemed great. I quickly learned that the carpet, which was suppose to be \""upgraded\"" was WORSE than the As-Is unit. It is a cheap tan berber carpet that looks completely filthy and destroyed within an hour of walking on it. Maintenance was so slow to respond to a leak in the bathroom and then shut off the water completely in the bathroom and never told us when it would be back on! After 7 months in the unit, I was informed that I had to vacate within 2 months because the owner of the unit (I was never informed it was a privately owned unit at any point) wanted us out, even though we payed rent promptly every month. In fit and a hurry, my roommate and I moved into a 3 bedroom because we were thinking the space would be nice...IT WAS A LEMON!!!\n\nWhen I go my keys, the office girl told me the carpet was new and that there was a hole in the master bedroom door (my room) and that it would be replaced a.s.a.p. Well, it took them ONE MONTH to finally give me a new door! Not to mention that my bedroom door wouldn't even close all the way unless I shoved it and when I asked them to fix it, they didn't! The carpet was not new and one of the laundry doors fell off. A few months later, the oven didn't work at all and it keep shorting out our power when we tried to fix it. When I went to the office for help (Because no one EVER answers the phone) I saw a sign on the door stating the office closed early...for the super bowl! Like it counted as a holiday!). I hated this apartment so much that I actually moved out early, moved in with my boyfriend, and continued to pay my portion of the rent. IT WAS A NIGHTMARE!!!\n\nThe worst part is when I left. In the past, I never had deposit issues, until it was in regards to me leaving the complex. The staff was snotty and cold. Then I get a $1100 bill in the mail from them! They claimed that the carpet damage was irreversible and it needed to be replaced. I fought it and fought it, I even met with the maintenance man who signed off on my move in check list that stated the carpet was not new and not in good condition. HE ADDMITTED THAT THE CARPET THEY SUPPLY IS A CHEAP BERBER AND IS EXTREMELY POOR IN QUALITY AND HE ADMITTED THAT NEARLY ALL OF THE TENANTS HAVE TO PAY TO GET IT REPLACED!!!! HE COMPLETELY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SAN SIMEON SCREWS PEOPLE!!! HIS NAME IS RENEE, IN CASE YOU EVER NEED TO KNOW.\n\nThe staff is uneducated, lazy, and unresponsive. The maintenance does not care and is slower than a snail to respond. The apartments are a joke and poorly constructed. Please, don't waste your hard earned money.",0
2608,0,"We got a deal for $45 per night during a conference so we stayed here. There was also a $15 per night resort fee which said it covered in-room internet, the gym, etc. When it said in-room internet I just assumed it meant wireless. It doesn't. You pay $15 per night for wired internet (if you brought a cable and if you can find the plug...we couldn't). \n\nThere is no wifi available at all in the rooms. None. So, the first day I camped in Starbucks all day and paid $9.99 for slow wifi. On the second day I discovered that if you sit in the Bazaar area, you can connect to the MGM or Mirage free wifi and get better signal that you can get from the service you have to pay for elsewhere in the hotel. The chairs are also more comfortable and the ladies that work at the snack shop there are really nice.\n\nOur room was in one of the towers and it looked like it hadn't been upgraded in ages. The door handles were all scuffed and scratched. For some reason you don't get a real comforter either. Just a sheet, a thin blanket and a \""satin\"" cover. Saving on laundering costs I suppose?\n\nThe walls are also very thin. We could hear everything going on in the rooms next door. Even just the flush of a toilet can be heard.\n\nThe elevators are literally falling apart. Many buttons are missing and the control panel is exposed in many of them. I felt oh so safe.\n\nThe housekeeping staff doesn't follow the \""towels on the floor need to be replaced, those hanging don't\"" rule. I try to conserve water in hotels by not asking for new towels every day. I don't get them at home, why would I in  hotel? But they replaced them every day anyway. Not very \""green.\""\n\nMy final, and biggest, complaint is that the room keys are terrible. In 3 days I had to get 4 new keys because they stop working if you get them anywhere near a credit/debit card or a cell phone. I'm a girl, I keep everything in a purse. How am I supposed to keep the key away from everything in my purse? I tried by surrounding the room key with business cards but that didn't work.\n\nOne night at 3 AM, I returned to my room and my key didn't work. I went to the front desk to get it fixed (again) and they said their system was down so they couldn't give me a new key. They told me to wait by the elevators for someone from housekeeping to let me in my room. I waited by the elevators and no one showed up. So I went back to the front desk and finally got a new key. When I got up to my room, the phone rang and it was housekeeping telling me that someone from the front desk was \""looking for me\"" and then put me on hold. I hung up after waiting 30 seconds.\n\nI will never stay at this hotel again. I guess you really do get what you pay for.",0

2611,0,"I am officially not a fan. I went here tonight with some friends to see Tangled. We get stopped at the door and they ask to search my bag. First off, searching bags of customers have gotten a LOT of theaters in trouble, even sued. THESE SEARCHES ARE ILLEGAL. It's called privacy invasion. So good job there. Secondly, even if I am carrying snacks (which I was - let's be honest, those prices are extortionate even for a \""dollar\"" theater and there's not too many vegan goods) I was still going to buy popcorn - that story will come in a moment. Debate about the ethical reasoning of bringing in snacks all you want, but I don't want anyone searching my private property unless they are actual security or police. \n\nSo we take our snacks back to the car and go into the theater. My friends go to find a seat, and I stand in line for some popcorn. Note that there are no signs saying CASH ONLY anywhere. (NOTE: my friend paid for the movie so I didn't notice at the box office if signs were there or not.) When I finally get to the counter after 7 minutes of waiting (seriously the staff was working like they were underwater) I am told they don't take cards, but I can go to the ATM off to the side. Are you freakin' serious?! Why the hell would I go to an ATM when all I want is a small popcorn? There should be signage so I didn't have to waste my damn time. This subsequently put me in an awful mood for the rest of the time I was there. \n\nAs for the theater - when they shut off the lights you can't see a thing. It took me 2 minutes to find my friends. The sound quality of the movie was not great and I could hear every single person munching on popcorn and slurping drinks. So not enjoyable. Kids running around screaming and crying as well - overall a complete disaster. \n\nTreating your customers as criminals is not okay in my book, and I can assure you I will not be back here - I would rather pay the extra dough for stadium seating, debit card acceptance, and not having my bag searched (it wasn't even a big bag!). And that's saying a lot from someone who likes spending her money on shoes. Shame on you, Tropicana Cinemas.",0

2613,0,"My friend and I swung by Phillip's for a quick bite while our plane made a stop in Charlotte (our gate was right next to the restaurant). It's pretty simple - sit down, place your order when a waiter comes around, and get your food pretty quickly. The only real complaint is that the food's a bit expensive (as all airport food is) and that they didn't have BBQ sauce when I requested it for the chicken tenders. Aside from that, the food was pretty much what'd you expect overall from this kind of joint. The tenders were pretty standard, served with honey mustard sauce. The seafood platter comes with fried shrimp, crab cakes, and some spring rolls. I felt better for not getting the bigger crab cakes when I had theirs - the crab meat was extremely nondescript, coated in fried breadcrumbs but with an indistinguishable taste aside from that. The spring rolls were okay, if unspectacular, and the fried shrimp was decent.\n\nYou're not going to get much service here - our waiter had to be flagged to give us our check - but it's an airport spot, so you can't really set expectations too high. I'd probably stop by if I wanted something other than standard fast food in the airport, but there's not much any other reason to come by here.",2

2619,0,"The following is a detailed review of the Tropicana Cinemas, a subsidiary of Regency Theaters.  My husband and I visited the cinema for the first time for a Saturday 7 p.m. showing of Captain America 2.  The theater and our auditorium were busy, with approximately 70 - 80 seeing the show.\n\nWe thought the (P)Leather seats were comfortable, clean and well maintained.  A repeat customer commented on the fact that there were new seats in the theater (we were in Auditorium #3).  I like the pleather seats much better than cloth and the seats rocked back and a nice incline.  Seat rows are not too close.  There is only one auditorium and no upper and lower levels.  The minus with the seats is that the back is high.  Since the theater floor does not incline that much, this means that anyone standing up in front of you will block the screen and/or shorter guests (children) might have a hard time seeing the screen.  That's probably why I noticed a very large stack of booster seats in the lobby.\n\nThere are five auditoriums.  When the lobby is busy, you can hear noise from the congestion in that area.  Theater has one box office window.  At the time of this writing, tickets were $2.00 each ($1.00 on Tuesdays) and $3.50 for 3D showings.  Tickets for this theater cannot be purchased online.\n\nUpon purchasing a ticket, you enter the doors on the right.  There is one security/ticket taker stand, and a small concessions area.  The security person does request to look inside women's purses. \n\nThe sign at the Security Stand states:  \""No Outside Food or Drink - CASH ONLY.\""  Bag Policy:  No shopping bags, no trash bags, no luggage bags, and no large bags of any kind.  All hand bags, side bags and purses brought into the Tropicana Cinemas are subject to search.   Staff and management reserve the right to refuse any and all bags.  We cannot hold any items for any reason.  You may enter the building 20 minutes prior to the show.  Ticket sales are no longer available 20 minutes after start of show.  We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.  Not responsible for items left in theaters.  These policies apply to everyone.  No Exceptions.\""\n\nThe prices at the concession stand are not discounted and most items are comparable to a regular movie theater.   I know from my days working at a movie theater that the box office money goes to the movie makers and the concession stand goes to the theater, so see why prices are high.    There is one long line for concessions.\n\nPrices at the time of this writing for concessions:\n\nPOPCORN:\nLarge Popcorn (free refill) - $6.26, Medium Popcorn - $5.25, Small Popcorn $4.25.  Combo #1 (Family Combo) - $19.75 [two large drinks, one large popcorn, one nachos].\n\nCOMBOS:\nCombo #2 - $18.00 [2 Icee, 1 Nachos, 1 Pretzel].  Combo #3 - $15.25 [two large drinks, one large popcorn].  Combo #4 - $11.50 [one super nachos, one large drink] / All combos come with your choice of a free Sour Jacks or Muddy Bears Candy.  \n\nKIDS COMBOS:\nOne kids tray of popcorn, one 12 ounce soda and one kid's candy is $5.00 (if purchasing the Kid's combo with an Icee, then it's $5.75).\n\nDRINKS:\nLarge Drink (free refill) - $4.50, Medium Drink -$4.00, Small Drink - $3.50.  Icee - $4.75, Large Water - $4.00, Small Water - $3.00\n\nCANDY:   $2.75, $3.50, and $3.75\n\nSNACKS:  $1.00 for Hot Dogs (Eisenberg brand); Pretzels\n\nThe lobby in general is congested.  There is an ATM machine present along with many arcade games.  The lobby is the center hub for accessing the five auditoriums as well as the men's and women's restrooms - a lot of activity in a small place.  The restrooms were clean (trash not emptied as typical at most movie theaters).  Place in general is old but clean and maintained.\n\nOn the theater's Weekly Movie Guide, they advertise a \""Reward Program.\""  However, when we inquired about this, we were told that the Reward Program does not apply to this location.  However, you can sign up for e-mails about future screenings or download the Regency Cinemas phone app for show times.  Theater can also be \""liked\"" on Facebook.  Group rates and rentals are also available; call (702) 248-7469 for details.\n\nThree previews were shown prior to the show.  There were a lot of people talking loudly at the beginning of the movie, but finally stopped after the first five minutes. Also, there was a small line of late arrivers up to 5 minutes after the movie started, and an usher helped seat them. The Manager was visible several times, seen standing in the lobby.\n\nThis theater is truly \""discounted\"" if you live in the area and if you don't purchase from the concession stand.  However, if you have to drive far or if you purchase from concessions, then there isn't that big of a savings.  For us, we missed a general run of a blockbuster movie but still wanted to see it on the big screen.   Thank goodness this theater was not \""ghetto fab\"" but just too far for us, as we will return occasionally.  Most people would probably enjoy this entertainment option.",2
2620,0,"Drive thru is 24 hours except late nights they're under staff which is really annoying because every time I come here around 11pm or later it always takes about 15-30 minutes to get my order. This has happened 3 times already, to the point where I just put my car on park and the car behind me would turn off their engine. Not sure why they only have 1 girl working at night, there's something wrong with that. Other than that my smoothie was great, just not happy with how slow the service is at night!",0
2621,0,"This is a great program and it has been working really well for me.  I started on December 29th and over the last 6 weeks I've lost 33 pounds.  I'm a big guy and weighed in at 276.  My goal is 180. The first week I lost 14 pounds and since then I've been averaging 4 pounds a week.  It's any easy diet to follow and if you're willing to do a little bit of cooking you can add enough variety and flavor to not get bored.  My energy levels are good and getting better all the time.\n\nMy sister and brother-in-law live in Henderson and raved about their weight loss results and the ease of staying on the program.  So I bit the bullet and a bit of skepticism (will this work for me?) and went to the Henderson clinic while visiting over the holidays.  The staff was professional and knowledgeable and answered my questions.  The wait was about 10 minutes to see a counselor which seemed reasonable.  Since starting, I've called in with some questions and if I didn't get a counselor immediately I got a callback within the hour.\n\nI'm eating about a 1000-1200 calories a day.  If you're a guy you will probably need to.  Use a scale to weigh out your portion sizes otherwise a 5 to 6oz hamburger can become 7 or 8oz.  \n\nTake your own blood pressure if you have a cuff at home.  Mine has dropped from 135/85 to 110/72.  I'm on blood pressure meds and while I've not experienced any dizziness if you do you may need to have your meds adjusted by your doctor.  If you're going into the clinic on follow-up make sure you get them to take your BP.  \n\nThe program is not inexpensive but you will find yourself spending less on groceries so it is probably a wash.  I think the spray makes a difference but don't ask me how.  Had my sister and BIL not had success I would just have assumed it's a scam.  IT IS NOT.  Good luck!",4
2622,0,"okay I really really really want to give kudos to this restaurant due to it being a Phoenix icon.  however they are struggling  financially right now and I think the reason is that while other steakhouses have embraced the fact that people want to eat healthier, adding salads and less filling foods to their menu, this place has decided to keep a very old school steakhouse fried chicken mantra.  I am gluten free and can only order ribs or chicken with no barbecue sauce.  I do have breakfast but it stops at noon which would alleviate the problem of me trying  trying to find something to eat.  because of the lack of items that I can eat, combined with the fact that my vegetarian daughter can find nothing to eat,  we won't be back so they  lost my entire family.  it's great to have traditions but you also have to change with the times.",0

This is 'authentic' mexican; not Macayos.  \nA few downsides though, it is really small & not really built for families or large groups; plus, I wouldn't park in the neighboring streets.

2637,0,"I will always give any Albertson's one or two stars simply due to the fact that they refuse to put in self check-out lanes. One time the manager told me that his customers requested they get removed...really? The three's a crowd rule is dumb especially when you only have one lane open or maybe two and even then one of the lanes is 15 items or less. This is a backwoods store who is not willing to advance to the future and give customers a guaranteed fast way to buy their groceries. Nothing else here really stands out and they don't really make their own bakery items. The best thing I have found is the Instant Rice, for some reason this rice kicks butt over the big names of rice. I also get annoyed when the checkers leave their area and come outside the checker zone (standing in front of lane) while I'm pulling in with my cart. This just wastes time overall, it is like a toll collector leaving the booth when I want to pay my toll.\nAlso, I don't like Halloween stuff appearing in August.",0
2638,0,"I think this is the first time I've ever given a 1 star review. It's not that I want to give Otto a 1 star, but I am compelled to.\nLet me start out with some of our mistakes or variables that you have to account for when eating out:\n- we came a little after 11am on a Saturday morning (aka right when they open)\n- we expected a lot from this place since it has a \""Mario Batali\"" on its sign\nOur server was quite nice, tried very hard to sell us the appetizers, but we only wanted to grab a quick bite before gambling - plus, we had to leave at 2pm to catch our flight, so we are basically in a rush.\nThe bread was okay - my friend said it was grainy. Their breadsticks came in a package - they were alright.\nWhen the food came...that's when the nightmare started. We had a long night of partying, were running on 4hours of sleep and planned to go to the Wynn Buffet but decided there was not enough time, so Otto it is.\nBack to the food. I thought Italian food is supposed to be all about olive oil, tomatoes, basil and al dente pasta. What we got was SALT SALT SALT. We got:\n- overly salty lasagna\n- overly salty other pastas (I forgot the names)\nThey were horribly salty. My friend ended up telling the server his pasta was too salty (and the pastas were nowhere near al dente - some were over and under cooked). He then ended up getting an arugula salad with parmesan cheese - that wasn't great either because it was overly oily.\nOverall, the food didn't look as pretty as the Venetian atmosphere surrounding us and I probably won't be going back again. \n\nLesson of the day: take into consideration the variables I mentioned above and hopefully you'll have a better experience here like most of the other yelpers.",0
2639,0,"The good:  \n-I love their shirts.  I'm 6 ft 185 and size L fits me perfectly.  I am usually right between M and L so it can be tough. Great designs and material as well.\n-Price is right, and they always have sales\n-You get $ back for every purchase\n-Service seems good when you call or email they do respond.\n\nThe bad:\n-My first purchase took forever to ship, like over a month.  and finally they told me it was out of stock.  Only store credit, no refund.\n-They have had site issues where it was impossible to skip your crate, now fixed though\n-I bought a sport coat from them in my normal size, 41.  Great material, but the sizing is absolutely ABSURD.  I don't know why I didn't return it, dumb move.  The arm holes are sized to fit an emaciated manchild.  My arms barely squeeze into them and it's just about impossible to wear.  The coats are also really short, they look funny.

While I was in there for the appointment, the doc had me try on 3 different sets w/in a matter of 10 mins.  Left there w/ an OK pair but not the right ones.  They said they were going to order the next pair of trials for me as they didn't have them in stock.  Call 2 weeks later to see if they were in as I was told it only takes 7-10 business days, was told I would get a call back, never received one.  Called 2 days later and they said they weren't in yet but it would be w/in the next few days. Call couple of days later, still not in and then tell me there was a mix up on my order so they had to reorder.  I asked for another trial pair as the ones he gave me on my 2nd visit were old now.

Yummy martinis that were perfectly crafted. 2nd round came from a different bartender. They all sucked. Paying $10 a pop for inconsistent drinks is a bummer!\n\nFood: calamari was excellent. Crisp and a great portion size. Foccacia on the table was warm and delish. My ahi tuna salad was gross unfortunately. The tuna wasn't fresh.. it wasn't seasoned.. it was just bland chewy mush on my plate. The salad came dressed (when I asked for dressing on the side). The plate wasn't put together particularly well.... just not a great salad (especially compared to the delish ahi crunch salad at Yardhouse!!).

2647,0,"After opening just 5 days after buying the building, the bar was sparse at first. It was, however, filled with delicious food that is ever changing, a draft selection that is also always in rotation, barreled and bottled cocktails during the week, and always some fantastic and inventive cocktails on Saturday nights, when their \""Cocktologist\"" is in. Now, a few months later, the remnants of the previous bar are all stripped away, and the walls are filled with classic records, and wonderful prints by talented and local artist Matthew Buchholz of Alternate Histories. I love this place.\n\nTo address some previous reviews:\nLocal Beers\nThe taps change constantly, because there are a TON of breweries within 150 miles of Pittsburgh. And there's NOTHING wrong with featuring only local brews. To the guy that's posted on here, and their Facebook, and everywhere else that they should have a guest brewery: If you want beer from outside of the local area, go to any other craft beer bar in Pittsburgh. There are tons of them. The Independent Brewing Company is the ONLY bar in Pittsburgh that features ONLY local beers, and even offers ALL the locally produced spirits. \n\nThe Food v Cost\nAre you people insane? Look at the various menus they've posted online on Twitter and Facebook. The cheapest thing on the menu is about $5, and the most expensive has been about $15. And this is too expensive for you for fresh made food that doesn't use frozen or manufactured food?!? Really? Everything is made fresh. By hand. No frozen fries, no prepackaged crap. And the most expensive dish I've seen was $15. You can pay more than $15 for an entree at TGIFridays. \n\nDecor\nThey opened 5 days after taking control of the bar. It's previous incarnation, Fanatics, was the embodiment of every trashy Pittsburgh sports bar, with nicotine stained tin signs, neon signs, TUBE television sets hanging from the ceilings (Yes, TUBE television sets, multiples), and 30 years of dinginess. They reopened 5 days later...FIVE. No contractors, just the owners and the helping hands of close friends to make it presentable enough to open. This included a handmade mosaic with the IBC logo, great chairs, and some other minor renovations. Now the joint is covered in prints from Alternate Histories, which are hilarious. Take the time to look at them. Totally cool. And a huge selection of records....because iPhones and digital playlists are verboten.\n\nCocktails v Cost\nGone are the days of $6 cocktails with rubbing alcohol quality booze, that are overly sweet, and come in a pint glass. Deal with it Pittsburghers. A good bar means good cocktails, and not just good cocktails, but inventive cocktails made with only the best ingredients. The resident Saturday night bartender, Adam Henry, has done a damn fine job of creating a cocktail program for the bar. Not only can you get delicious bottled and barreled cocktails during the week, but he's there every Saturday with some of the most interesting cocktails in the city. Dry ice, emulsification, liquid nitrogen, obscure ingredients, and some really great presentation. Don't believer me? Order the London Fog, or the Sex Panther. Even if you don't see it listed on the chalkboard. Just make sure you're sitting at the bar.\n\nAnd for those of you wondering, I'm not an owner, or friend of the owner put up to writing this review. I've just gone enough to write a proper review, and thought it might be helpful to have all the info. Thanks for taking the time to read it!",4
2648,0,"Excellent casino and steak.\n\nCab driver mentioned is on the way in from the airport when I asked about good, cheap eats. Decided to head over and wasn't disappointed. \n\nThey have reasonable table limits so you can stretch your gambling money if you just want to play a little for a cheap price. It's not a big casino but they have all the major games covered. \n\nThe real star of the show is the 8.99 steak special. For nine bucks you get a 10 oz steak, baked potato, salad, green beans, and a beer of your choice. I expected the steak to be a thin, cheap, grisly piece of meat. But it was actually a nice cut that was cooked perfectly. \n\nIf you don't have a players card the price is 11.99 and it doesn't come with a beer. It's still a good deal at that price. Our server was nice enough to let us use an extra voucher that he had, and that made it even better.",4
2649,0,"We stopped here later at night because Two Hippies Beach House was closed.  I'm glad we did, because the food was pretty decent.  I was a little nervous walking in because the whole place was empty, but that might have been because it was about to close (which we unfortunately didn't realize...so we left a generous tip ;) ).\n\nMy fiance asked, as he always does: \""what's good here?\""  The guy at the counter responded \""anything seafood!\""  Of course. It's not called Mariscos for nothin'.\n\nSo I ordered two shrimp tacos and one grilled marlin taco, since I'd never had marlin before.  All were delicious.  I didn't realize the shrimp in the tacos would be breaded, which I usually don't like, but it was pretty good.  The shrimp tasted good and juicy, and the toppings were nice (cabbage, pico de gallo, and cilantro).  The horchata seemed like it was homemade, and it was delicious.  The chips weren't the best, and they gave us a green salsa, which my fiance said would be too hot for me, so I didn't try it.\n\nI took a look at their full menu while I was waiting for my food and they have a very decent selection.  We will definitely be back. Soon :)",2
2650,0,Got this as a gift from Groupon....it was actually alot of fun...we knew we would get our butt kicked by a bunch of 12 year olds....but with that being said....they give you a 10 minute orentation about the rules which all make sense. the people managing the field do nto pay attention and inforce these safety rules. teams are not matched fairly....a bunch of 12 year olds agains a pro team....a guy on the other team stuck the barrell of his fully auto paitball gun under my face mask after he was shot out and shot me in the face. after i was out i proceeded to leave the field with my hands in the air ( as instructed) and the same guy unloaded about 15-20 rounds on me within 5 feet which again is against the rules. i questioned the guy on why he did it and he grabbed me by the shirt and proceeded to instigate a fight.  ALL OF THIS HAPPENED IN FRONT OF A YOUNG BLONDE FEMALE STAFF MEMBER WHO DID NOTHING! the staff didnt do much about this other than appologize and offer me a free visit. they contunued to let the violent gentelman stay and play when he should of been kicked out. there was also a dad and his 3 kids that  questioned the staff about the rules not being followed and they ended up leaving due to carelessness from the staff. needless to say....it would of been a ton of fun if the rules given were monotored.

2651,0,"I am writing this review based on this specific location. I live quite a bit away but due to a \""youtube\"" video I decided to give Dr. Alonge a try. I needed to discuss quite a few things but upon arrival at the office there was no receptionist at the front. When she finally got there I had to do this bubble scan tron. I guess this location is doing a Pilot of this new system. Its terrible and very IMPERSONAL. What is worse is that the Doctor and Medical Assistant were able that way as well.  The Doctor literally didn't look up from his computer once he started imputing things. He didn't ask what I was doing as far as my LIFE he just tried to make a assessment based on this quiz that he didn't even tell me about when half the time I was giving joking responses. He seemed very robotic and definitely wasn't a good fit but that isn't why this place is getting one star because with doctors that happens my issue is with the staff. I literally sat for over thirty minutes waiting to get my labs done without any idea as to who was coming or when. This location has a small one room lab and the lady was nice when she finally arrived but I had to go SEARCHING to be able to find someone to try to locate the lady to get a estimate the medical assistant was no where to be found. Once I was trying to exit after it was all said and done this lady at the exit door REFUSED to let me leave she told me I had to WAIT to check out. I was NEVER planning to come back to this place again nor was I instructed that I needed to see the check out people but guess what? she still gave me a hard time and when I finally did get to the lady I HAD ALREADY SIGNED THE PAPER that they wanted to prove I was here. Overall it was a terrible experience and since I like Health Care Partners Pediatrics I will probably try out another location but overall this was the PITS!",0

2655,0,"Check-in was extra fabulous! The person working the desk was very friendly. Sadly, it kinda went down hill from there. \n\nIt looks like they've done a fairly recent remodel on this Courtyard, but they skimped a bit on the rooms during the remodel. The bathroom in my room had old outdated floor tiles and crappy plastic on the surround around the tub/shower.They have horrible shower curtains that try very hard to cling to you in the shower which is not a pleasant experience knowing that the curtains have tried to cling to countless strangers in the past. Yuck! The grout between the floor tiles had a fair amount of black mold in it and there was clearly lots of the stuff growing in the pipes in the sink. The stench coming from the sink was godawful and actually got worse when the water was turned on. \n\nThe restaurants in Courtyards are just blehh. I should have just gone out to get carry out on my first night. I missed a very large chunk of the World Series game waiting for my overly microwaved food. They had only one person working in the restaurant and she was clearly overwhelmed.\n\nUpon checkout, I attempted to get the person working the front desk to take me seriously when I told her that they really shouldn't put anyone in that room until they tackle the mold problem, but it was clear from her tone of voice and the look on her face that she didn't particularly care and she thought I was a complaining pain in the ass who she wished would just shut up and leave her alone. I get it...you probably get a lot of complaints, but exposing people who might be sensitive (think severe allergies or asthma) because you can't be bothered to write it down and follow up...that really sucks.\n\nAnd speaking of being a complaining pain in the ass, this hotel has the horrible Marriott pillows that are unreasonably underfilled rendering them uncomfortable and fairly useless.\n\nSo that's it. The Summerlin Courtyard will not be at the top of my wish list for places to stay when traveling to Las Vegas. In fact, it was bad enough that I will be notifying my company's travel department so that they can consider removing it from our preferred list.",0

Our beef jerky gets to the table when we had asked for med rare. Their bread was as hard as concrete, the meat was dry, and even the med rare pieces that came out after we complained was flavorless and only saved by a healthy amount of A1. I dont like A1.\nNo discounts offered. No apology from the host that took our order. Scrambled eggs were ok, sunny side up were burnt and about the size of quail eggs. Thats about it. And their costco mini muffins were good. \nThe couple behind us were super annoyed about something too. \nNO GOOD!",0
2659,0,"This is NOT the famous Grimaldis pizza that everyone hears about.  There's a fuss over who gets to use the name, presumably it's either the location on Scottsdale Rd. or the new location just off the 101 at Northern in Peoria.  Either way, this is not the famous Grimaldis.\n\nPizza is very average.  Service is usually poor, and usually from teenage kids with little to no training as servers.  In fact, it's unclear whether it is full serve or not.  Sometimes you have to go up to the counter to order, and other times they correct your behavior and insist that you sit down first.\n\nPizza by the slice isn't so great in the afternoon hours because it is reheated stuff from much earlier with a drizzle of fresh cheese put on top of the old, starting to form skin crusted cheese.\n\nAfternoon happy hour attracts an unsavory crowd looking for cheap chicken wings and light beer.\n\nFamily owned, but who cares if the service is often bad and the food isn't so great.",0

And while the Pirates are not the best Pittsburgh sports team, I think I would rather go to a Pirates game even over a Steelers or Pens game.

However the main drag of this place is the painful noise level, driven by the in-house band singing Happy Birthday songs at just about every table, with wireless mikes and amplified guitars...

2665,0,"After living in Vegas for over 8 years now I've eaten quite a few burgers all over town, but since starting this blog I've had to look at many of them in a whole new light. One burger I've eaten many times is the one at All-American Bar & Grille at the Rio because I used to work down the street. I remembered it being decent, but how does it hold up now that I'm being completely subjective?\n\nThe front seating area of All-American is a fairly clean, loud area with a big bar and lots of TV's, open directly into the equally loud and slightly more hideous casino floor. It's great for people watching as the Rio doesn't always attract the most savory folks. It was especially great the day I went for my burger, as NASCAR was in town. Need I say more? The back seating area of the restaurant is a bit 'nicer'; if you're coming here for a steak you might want to eat back there.\n\nBoth the lunch and dinner menus are fairly similar, featuring a wide variety of steaks and pretty much every generic thing offered in all bars across the country. The choice of the day for me was the All-American Classic Burger which I got with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, Swiss cheese, and the standard lettuce, tomato and onions. What gets served to you is a decent presentation, but I was a bit disappointed by the waffle fries that I immediately saw on my plate as I'm typically not a fan and I wasn't given a choice for anything else. The meat had decent flavor, but was way overcooked from the medium-rare I had ordered, while my friend's medium was cooked how I would have liked. Did they mix up our orders or can they just not cook to order properly? The bun had good flavor, but was a bit too thick and way too dry. The saut\u00e9ed mushrooms had peppery good flavor, and the Swiss was melted and tasted good. And while I used maybe  of the lettuce they provided me, all of the veggies were fresh and good as well.\n\nMy waffle fries as I mentioned were quite disappointing; kind of stale, not very hot and pretty generic. For years coming to All-American I remembered getting a basket of random fries; some waffle, curly, skinny, and fat. That would have been more welcome as I liked the variety, even if it seemed like you were always eating from a mixed bottom of the barrel.\n\nOverall the burger was good, but nothing out of this world. $12.99 is probably about right for a casino location such as this, but I think it's a little steep for what it is. Plus the service has typically been less than stellar every time I've been there. I think on this particular trip our waitress took our food order and drink order at the same time. Talk about being prompt. There probably aren't too many other choices off the strip by the Rio, but if you're at the property and want a burger you can't go wrong, just don't go out of your way to come here.",3
2666,0,Excellent tapas!  I am picky and I think I've tried more than half the menu and every dish has been outstanding.  The Sangria is also very tasty... I ended up drinking almost an entire pitcher last time I went!\n\nThe line is usually out the door and parking is limited.  The restaurant is next to the popular Ruth's Chris Steak House and a few other restaurants.  Makes parking a hassle as the lot in front of the businesses gets filled quickly.

2674,0,"Went to Puck's, last minute, for dinner with family. Located in Crystals Mall on the Strip near Aria, it has a bright semi open space, with a nice small bar area. Only had to wait 10 minutes for a Friday night walk-in around 9PM. Staff was adequately attentive.\n\nOverall, food was good. I tried the grilled ribeye steak, which was probably the priciest entree on the menu at $40. But it was cooked perfectly to my order (medium rare) with an unctuous reduction sauce which I wish I had more off. Topped off, it had a nice stem of mushrooms and blackened green chiles. (which was a nice touch of heat) to the dish. A perfectly acceptable opening meal night in Vegas. Nothing too fancy or spend, but good food still.\n\nSampled the tiramisu dessert at the end. Tasted really good. It had these nice chocolate beads in the creamy layer that added a surprising little crunch to the dish.\n\nEven though it's a mainly pasta/pizza & some seafood place, I can safely recommend the ribeye here.

A pound is enough for me to share with my husband.  Love the added on corn on the cob and sausage (half pound addition is plenty!).  I did have one time where the shrimp was so overcooked it was impossible to peel is cleanly, but normally its pretty awesome.  For $9.99, I would say that the value isn't bad!\n\n$14.99 buys you a pound of snow crab legs.  I really hate paying for snow crab legs when I know I can have as much as I want at a buffet... but one night we were really craving it.  Verdict - not worth it.  Overpriced and despite it being soaked in spices, bland.  \n\nI recommend getting the whole shebang in medium (its plenty spicy!)  Its the perfect blend of spicy garlicky goodness.\n\nDo try the cajun fries (so worth it!).  I haven't been able to try any of their other fried stuff yet, but looking fwd to it.\n\nOh yeah - don't forget to bring your Sharpies to tag up the walls!",0

2679,0,"I am a fan of Guy Fieri and this makes the second restaurant from DDD I have visited. I will be honest and tell you that he co-owns two restaurants in California, one of them being a place called Johnny Garlic's. The food was VERY VERY mediocre so I started to wonder if I should trust his taste in food, but then I said ok he goes to these places because people write to him and tell him they are amazing, not because he has any participation in the restaurant itself. So my mom and I went yesterday (Saturday) morning for breakfast. \n\nWe got there around 9 I think and we had to wait about an hour before we were able to be seated. \n\nWe looked at the menu and were like what the heck this is just basic breakfast food, did we just make a huge mistake? Boy were we wrong. The OJ was great. The coffee on the other hand, eh. I've had a lot better. \n\nI ordered the omelet with provolone and mushrooms and onions and home fries and sourdough bread. \n\nMy mom ordered the eggs with hashbrowns and slice of ham. \n\nThe omelet was huge and gooey with cheese. The mushrooms and onions were cooked to perfection. The home fries were only ok, and that might be because they were a tad cold. The bread is obviously homemade and the jam that came out with it was incredible. \n\nMy moms ham was great. We were not expecting such a big slice and such a thick slice. The taste was amazing as well. \n\nAfter breakfast we walked across the street and went to the farmers market. \n\nI am visiting from California, and should I ever find myself in Phoenix ever again, I will definitely come back and maybe next time try the bacon egg and cheese sandwich. \n\nThe only thing keeping this place from 5 stars is the coffee and the limited menu options.",2

Prices correctly reflect it's downtown location. However, food was just OK. Ordered crab cakes for some $28 and definitely not the best I've had.

Last night returned for the first time in about a year and unfortunately found not much has changed.\n\nThey somehow have moved away from a more classy menu to this big plastic sheet.  Makes me think of being at chillis..... In addition there was some sticky stuff on the menu which I wasn't to pleased about avoiding.\n\nWe started with the pork dumplings.  They were loose, a little cold and a tasted as though they had been sitting around for some time.  This is curious because we received them about 2 minutes after they were ordered.\n\nThe more important part for us is the sushi itself.   We had: \n\nPinwheel.... Sloppily put together.  Fish was extremely thick.\nTuna, yellowtail, seabass nigiri.  Everything was warm and we believed the sushi was not cut right it somehow seemed hard, lacking of the proper texture and simply did not taste fresh.\n\nThe server was very good by the way.\n\nFor our money ,we will stick with stingray and probably try pure again in another year.

2688,0,"I felt the frozen hot chocolate was a little hyped up.  It's just an iced version of hot chocolate.  I thought it was gonna be spectacular too.  By the way, you'd want to order the small since the order for 2 is large enough to feed 4 adults unless you want a sugar high.  My recommendation is a 3/5.\n\nThe entrees sampled are the crispy chicken salad and the crab cake sandwiches.  The crispy chicken salad is your regular old green salad with dressing of your choice.  What's different about it is the large fried chicken pieces that comes with it.  If you want to order a salad just to be conservative on the calories, you might want to eat less of the chicken and more of the greens.  Overall, the crispy chicken salad is 3/5 but the chicken gives it a +1 so it turns out to be 4/5.  The crab cake sandwich is just a plain old crab cake sandwich with an inflated price.  That's a 3/5.\n\nOverall, this place is between 3 and 4 stars with more leaning towards 3 stars.  Still, it's a nice place to go for a cold dessert on a hot desert summer day.",2

Stuff that I've put on will call (stocked items, like bulk tile, baseboards, and other like-items) on my LAR have never been available when asked for. They consistently mess up orders, and are consistently slow and inept at getting things right the first time.

A) there wasn't enough non-outdoor, non-sunny space to hang out in. Yes, it's Phoenix and people come here to get tan...but I live here, and burn ridiculously easily.

2694,0,"A little tough to find at first but we did eventually. Enter the Cosmopolitan Hotel off the strip and go to third floor using the escalator. Then go straight down the unmarked hallway right in front of you which is lined with old record sleeves. it opens up into a mostly standing room affair with a few stools along the walls, some pinball machines, and 2 TVs with sports.\n\nDrinks are sold from 2 liter bottles and poured into solo cups at something like $4 per cup. This is crazy expensive. Luckily they have a little water filtration machine that you can get free water from in the corner next to the cash register. This is the way to go.\n\nYou can order a custom pizza which takes a while, or they can just heat a slice from the already made pizzas. $4.50 for a cheese slice is the base price. You then add 50 cents for each additional topping. I had the pepperoni and sausage for $5.50, and felt like the price was a little up there for a single slice that wasn't even over-sized. \n\nSausage and peperoni was only ok. Sausage was there physically, but lacked any flavor. I'd skip that topping. Pepperoni was tasty and a little salty. Still not a huge winner, but a good standard slice.\n\nThe crust was good. Thin and crunchy, resisting sogginess for a while, and is a great starting point for these pizzas. \n\nThe white pizza was by far the best. Ricotta and garlic make this more resistant to sogginess, and the taste combo is delicious. Very subtle ricotta and not so subtle garlic really take this to the next level with the great crust. The white pizza is the one to get. Case closed.",0

From there we were escorted into the building and to our own private gun range with multiple lanes.  Above the lanes was a \""Happy Birthday\"" banner (which the birthday boy didn't even notice...  Go figure!).  The only downfall of the room was that it was freezing so be prepared for both hot and cold conditions when you go there!\n\nKetzu was our range master and he was great!  Very friendly, knowledgeable and definitely not pushy!

He did not hover over him while he shot the automatic weapons and gave him as much space as he needed.\n\nThis was my first experience with a rifle and Ketzu made me feel really comfortable with it in my hand and helped me with my stance and aim.

He had no patience with the large student group eating dinner together, and there wasn't any reason for him to have acted the way he did.  The group wasn't drunk, wasn't raucous, and was only a little chaotic because they were a little more focused on their conversation than who ordered what when their orders came out.\n\nThe white guy waiter with an attitude was largely offset by the very nice \""Mint Squid\"" (basil, actually) I had with sticky rice.  The dish was nicely seasoned, not too greasy, the rice was chewy, the woman who brought out my food was very nice, and she gave me a plate of cut orange for afterwards.

My rozmopolitan cocktail was to die for, and they made my husband a great drink as well.  The smoked salmon appetizer was delicious-- the potato blinis were the perfect vehicle for the salmon, and the horseradish creme wasn't overpowering.  For entrees, I had the four herb fettucine with steak and loved it.  The noodles were definitely closer to linguine than fettucine, but the sauce was light and delicious and the beef filet pieces were grilled very well.  My husband had the filet and said it was excellent; the fries that came with had a great balsamic sauce on top and the onion rings were a delicious bonus.\n\nOur second dinner was less exciting, but still very good.  We both had steaks; my sirloin was cooked perfectly at medium, but his ended up more medium well than medium rare, which was very unfortunate.\n\nThe breakfast is a standard Scottish breakfast, but everything is done very well.

I don't know about you guys but when I get a burrito I would like all the fillings to be in every bite.

I know avocados are expensive but if you are going to charge me $2.50 for guacamole please don't give me the smallest amount of guacamole you possibly can.

2728,0,"Tried this place on a friends suggestion, and I was hooked. Love the ambiance, and the food is amazing. The wait staff at this location are usually fairly attentive, genuine,  quick, and also they make good eye candy. Some of my personal favorites:\n\nShrimp ceviche- the ONLY place I will eat ceviche. Very acidic and refreshing\n\nStuffed Dates- I didn't think I was going to enjoy it, but it was a semi foodgasm. Warning, there are smoked almonds in this dish\n\nFirefly fries- I know, its fries but they are amazing fries, complete with a killer aioli, and covered in parmesan\n\nHam and cheese croquetas- creamy, slightly smoky, salty. Only complaint is the size, but it is a tapas joint\n\nFilet mignon sliders- talk about heaven. Order it medium rare for max juiciness. Comes topped with serrano ham, cabrales cheese (a cheese from the north of Spain, similar to gorgonzola I think), and caramalized onions.\n\nAlbondigas- Spanish style meatballs in a sherry tomato sauce. Meatballs are nice, unctuous, succulent, a perfect mouthful when paired with that sauce\n\n Caramel flan- Now I'm puerto rican, lived with puerto ricans and mexicans that made authentic flan, and this flan was sinful. perfect amount of sweet, the custard was really eggy with that beautiful caramelized taste.\n\nDesserts in general- Order the desert platter and get the trio of gelato on the side. The desert platter comes with the flan, a lemon and berry tart, choclate tres leche, passion fruit cheesecake. Surprisingly so, the tres leche was the consensual least favorite.\n\nItems that were not so great:\n\nCrispy Duck roll- Disappointing, because I love duck. But the duck was lost in the cherry hoisin sauce. It was cloyingly sweet.\n\nEmpanada- Hopefully my table just got a bad batch, because the pork inside the pastry was overcooked and dry.\n\nThat's pretty much it. Oh, the red wine Sangria, delicious. Order a whole pitcher, probably the best sangria I've ever had",4

Stumble to the bathroom, clean up, cover up last night's hair with a hat, don some big sunglasses, pick up friends and head to Florist. Order a mimosa, drink it, and order a bloody marry.

They always have discounted drink specials or cheap wine, the food is consistent and service is the best if you sit at the bar. \nFor dinner make sure to get the breads with herbed butter and the cheese plate.

While making the appointment, I informed the person I was speaking to that I preferred a female masseuse.

Peculiar, I thought, but no problem, sir. \n\nI told him that 5 weeks would put us into the month of January and I would be happy to schedule an appointment with a female during that time. He replied that he could not promise anything especially a female masseuse and that he does not schedule appointments that far ahead.

He went on stating that it should not matter who gives me a massage and that I should be happy with whomever I receive a massage from; \""I have been in business for over 25 years and this is not a normal request...\"" At this time, I simply stated that I would take my business elsewhere.\n\nJudging from what other people have stated, this is a solid spot to receive spa \nservices.

We had a couple questions about some of the sushi but instead of answering the questions or finding out she made us wait for an \""explanation display\"" which never really even answered our question.

They ran out of fries after taking our order that we were picking up without telling us.  That would have been nice to know before we picked up our order.  And then, they also go the order wrong.\n\nAnother time we ordered two orders of fries, one order had a lot of fries and the other had half of it, yet we were charged the same price for both.  We also ordered onion rings and I think that only 1/2 the container was filled, which onion rings are not very compact.\n\nThey would not honor a coupon from their own site.  What gives.  Tonight we ordered 3 subs and the subs were mediocre and had less meatballs than they had normally.  When I inquired why our order was so expensive, they said the price of their subs went up last week.  So, from earlier this spring the meatball subs were $5 and now $7?  Ridiculous price increase.\n\nMaybe the pizza is cheap, but I think we'll see if we can find another place nearby maybe towards Safeway area that is comparable.

I ordered the shrimp risotto with jumbo sea scallops, and while there was a decent amount of risotto, there were no more than 5 dime-sized shrimp all on one side of the dish, and the scallops were medium size- about the size of a quarter.  Worse yet, they had cut them in half putting the bronzed side up to make it look like more, so the three scallops I was looking at were only 1.5 scallops, and weren't even as thick as my pinky finger.  What was there tasted good even lukewarm, which is why I've given two stars rather than one, but the menu was a complete overstatement of the dish.\n\nThe couple in our group that had ordered the prix menu had to hail the waiter over to get their dessert and check so that they could make their 10 pm show, the rest of us, clearly also ready, had to hail him again after he disappeared after taking care of them (they did make their show, but missed some of the pre-show).  The other thing that really bugs me is that we were seated there over 2 and a half hours, saw a manager around, but they never approached our table for the standard \""how is everything\"".\n\nIf you insist on going to this restaurant (and with so many wonderful options in Vegas, I don't know why you would), do NOT go with 6+ people- it was very apparent from the evening that the servers were guaranteed their 18% automatic tip for groups, and thus completely blew us off.",0

2745,0,"Insanely good find!\n\nWe were visiting from out-of-town and staying on the strip, but decided to check out something a bit outside the \""normal\"" zone. This place was rated highly on Yelp, and so a taxi-ride later ($20), we were there. Where \""there\"" is exactly is hard to say for us, and we had to look around to find the exact location of the place (it's in the middle \""island\"" building on the right). It's located right in the middle of some Korean restaurants, and is definitely not your standard \""strip\"" business - it's not at all notable from the outside.\n\nThe inside is another matter. We chose to sit at the bar to watch the itamae at work, but we liked the set up of the tables and the main room. I was immediately intrigued by the aquariums in the back that housed live flounder, prawns, and abalone. I inquired about the abalone (it wasn't on the menu), and was a bit taken aback at the price ($25), but ordered it anyway due to the fact that we were on vacation, and I couldn't recall ever seeing it on a menu before. It was fantastic - very nice, firm, texture and a very oceany- (almost uni-like) taste.\n\nI decided to have some of the prawn, too (also not on the menu), and was very pleased with that, too. They serve the prawn raw, first, and after you've had the tail, they then tempura-fry the head. It was extraordinary!\n\nWe had some other dishes, too: some of them ordered by us, and some of them presented to us by the owner (we ordered a few things that weren't in-stock, and I think it was a very nice and appreciated gesture). Everything we had, from start to finish, was just excellent: fresh tako, hamachi, and unagi sushi, and a HUGE \""special\"" maki roll. The sake was good, and reasonably priced too. I was so full by the end of the meal, I couldn't fit any uni, and that's a first for me!\n\nThe only (very minor) complaint I have is that they didn't have closed-captioning on the TV's. \n\nI highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a fantastic meal of sushi in Vegas.. It doesn't have the ambiance of a Tao or Koi, and it's not a teppenyaki place, but that's not what I'm looking for in a sushi restaurant anyway. We spent over $50/person (because we wanted to..the food was GOOD!) but could just as easily have spent $25/person if we wanted to be more wallet-conscious.\n\nWe'll definitely be going back the next time we're there!",4

The salad came with a scone sized amount of goat cheese. It was so satisfying-- my goodness. The wedge was a standard wedge with loads of bacon bits. It was good. My salad was a perfect 10. I had the  salmon with roasted potatoes and sausage and my date had the bone-in rib-eye. My salmon was a generous portion and smokey-sweet in taste. It was decadent. I tasted the bone-in rib eye and man, it was perfectly cooked with all the moisture and flavor locked right in every bite. The creamed spinach was a nice side dish. I was very impressed with the service and ambiance. Delmonico's is classy and consistent to the other Delmonico's in the valley and BHills. For dessert, we had the peach cobbler and the homemade ice cream made the dessert. I was pleased with our choice-- next time we'll alternate between both restaurants... P.S. Scott M. was very helpful in offering us tips throughout the night. He was attentive and funny, too. Thanks for the good time! All in all, \""fine-dining restaurant, foodies joint, steakhouse\""\nThe damage: $350\nWorth it? ABSOLUTELY YES. The boyfriend got extra kisses!",4

I believe it was linked to Foursquare?? Not sure though.  \n\nWe took my mom out for a late Mother's Day dinner.  It wasn't crowded; which was great...though it got a bit crowded after 6pm.  While, we waited for my mom to arrive we sat at the bar.  My husband got a beer and he got a little surprise!  The glass in which the bartender poured the beer had a lipstick mark.  It was gross.  He told the bartender and looked at it in shock.  He gladly switched it out.  \n\nWe went with the family style \""classic\"" option which includes 2 appetizers, salads and desserts & 4 entrees.  We got the calamari and zucchini for appetizer.  The ceasar and spinach salad.  The chicken parm, grilled salmon, spaghetti w/ meatballs and gnocchi w/ italian sausage.  Spumoni ice cream and tiramisu for dessert.  My favorite was the calamari, cesar salad, chicken parm and desserts...everything else is okay.  I didn't care to much for the salmon, though.  The portions were huge; had to take a lot of it home.  I didn't understand how they just put the ice cream in a warm bowl...by the time we got it, it was melted.  Maybe they should put it in an ice bowl??  The waiter was nice and service was quick.  View is nice...oversees the Wynn properties.  There is also a man that walks around in his violin to play music for you; which I believe you have to tip him. \n\nIt's a good place to eat if there is a big group of you and craving Italian food.",2

The previous reviewers are right on the money when it comes to the ol' up-sell. You would think with all these reviews saying the same thing it would be looked into, and trust me, I understand the value of a good up-sell...but THREE times with THREE separate people? It's a little much. Plus, if I come in there initially inquiring over the $4.99 price and asking if there is anything lower than the $32 price (which to be fair, yes, there is) what in the world makes you think I am going to want to spend upwards of 60 dollars?

However, the food at the buffet was average for the most part and some even below average.  The seafood was good.  Crab legs and shrimp were great.  Had some sea bass that was totally over cooked and dry, there was no fresh fruit, only turkey and roast beef available.  Never been to a buffet without prime rib.

I figured that I'd better start documenting this search lest people begin to question my dedication to the task at hand.\n\nI hadn't been to Ella's since I relocated to Madison 7yrs. ago. So I figured that this Madison Institution would be a good place to start. So, the sandwich was pretty decent. The corned beef was delicious and not too greasy. I don't know why they don't serve it on a dark rye, like most every other place I've had one (we'll forget the sourdough I had once in the north woods). Loss of points here. My only other gripe would be that they could have spared some fries and made a bigger sandwich.\n\nThe reason for the two star rating is the service I received. I was one of maybe four customers in the whole place (everyone else was already seated and eating when I arrived), and it still took ten minutes for a staffer to bring a cup of water. The server's demeanor was short and far from sweet.\n\nSo, bring the kids to Ella's. That's the demographic they're going for. It's like Chuck-E-Cheese for the pre-teen steampunk crowd.

Also, the automatic blinds didnt work we had to have somebody come up and take a look at it and that took over an hr.  Room was HOT we turned it down to 65 still was warm u have to turn it down to like 61 there is no medium point.  Bed was soft i give them that.\n\nFor the pool it was nothing special u have to pay and arm and a leg to go into Liquid lounge to have fun, but liquid is small.  Nothing special and the vibe outside in the regular pool was for like OLD grandma and grandpas.  Some music would of been nice.  Waitresses were average looking nothing special.  Nothing about the pool had a WOW factor.\n\nThe floor lighting is dark both durin day and night on the floor.  No special bar that had a WOW factor to it on the floor.  Dealers and pit bosses were not fun.  Not enough baccarat tables.  Only hot waitress i saw was blonde russian lady WOW that was the only WOW factor i had at aria.  \n\nClub Haze was ok again no WOW factor to the club it was too big for the amount of ppl were there wasnt too packed.

I ordered an original lamb burger, which I have enjoyed in the past. This one was served to me with the hard plastic casing from the meat chub still surrounding the patty. INEXCUSABLE!!! The waffle fries we ordered were on the soggy side, and the wings were a lot spicier than the mild we ordered. I am not sure why our visit was this bad, as the restaurant was not overly busy.  I have enjoyed visits for a quick lunch in the past with no problems. This one just ruined all other visits.

2784,0,"I would have given one star, but the exterior did look good.  I wouldn't recommend the \""upgrades\"" that they offer. Long story short, I was offered a wax and declined. Next he commented on dirt marks on the interior door, and the leather seats. He said as he was tapping my drivers seat \""we can make these look like new\"" he also said that they were going to \""clean everything\"". It also sounded like he said something about leather conditioner for the seats, but I'm not sure because his accent was very thick. I figured I could use those services because the car is two years old, and the leather could use a cleaning. I agreed to that, and went inside to pay. The cost of the interior clean upgrade was significant, and I was expecting the job would reflect the cost of the service. The inside is nice. There are comfortable couches inside and TV. About 20 to 30 minutes pass, and my car was ready. I go out to look at the job they did, and it was very obvious that they did absolutely nothing to the seats. The rest of the interior was pretty clean but it wasn't an amazing job either. I commented on how the seats weren't cleaned to the guy who takes the ticket. His response was \""no, that is something different.\"" I told him that the guy at the entrance said that the seats would be cleaned as well.

On a regular day, it's poured correctly and in the normal glass pint. Obviously, the latter is better. \n\nHowever, those weekend nights are fun too. There is a cover of $5 for live music is great for Vegas. The band is fun - a mix of Irish and other musics, and they really get the bar going. \n\nThe food looked tasty, but I didn't have any.

2789,0,"This was my first stop after arriving in Montreal.  A bit exhausted from being up early to catch the flight in from LA, I was craving a good ol' burger and beer, with a low-key atmosphere.  This fit the bill perfectly.  The decor is dark and wooden, and reminded me of a contemporary Irish pub meets classic bistro.  \n\nService is friendly and courteous (and  they helped with directions to my next stop later), but a tiny bit slow.  Although, I presume this to be because food is not just a means of calorie intake in Montreal.  It is to be enjoyed and relished. :)  Which I did.  The burger is cooked to a well-done (they don't ask how you want it prepared), and I got mine with Mozzarella cheese - and it already comes with grilled onions on a tasty bun.  It definitely hit all the right belly spots.  Paired with a local brew (hmm.. I forget the name and unable to find it on their website, but I believe it was a Molson pilsner?..  if that even makes sense).  The meal also comes with a green salad and fries.  Excellent!  I like how in Montreal, most meals come with either a salad or fruit - and not \""extra\"".\n\nTotal was less than $20.  Good food, nice ambiance, cool location.  A pleasant introduction to my first night in Montreal.",2
2790,0,"We tried Five Guys for the first time this weekend.  The food is very good and you get big portions so you don't leave hungry.  However the burger where actually very greasy.  We did not realize that the regular burger are all double patties, for a normal size burger you get what they call a little burger.  I would not normally order a double bacon cheese burger, but I did not realize this fact until our food arrived.  There is no sign letting you know they are double patty burgers.  It's cool that they have a whole list of topping and you just choose whatever you want on the burger.  Every thing is made fresh and to order.  Word of caution to those who have peanut allergies, everything is cooked in peanut oil and they have boxes of peanuts lining the entry way.  The place is very clean and the people working seemed very nice.  \n\nThe reason I only gave it 3 stars instead of 4 stars is due to the high price.  I would say this is in no way a 5 star place.  This is basically a glorified fast food place.  You come in and stand in line to order get your number and drinks and wait for them to yell out your number.  Weather or not you are dining in you get your food in a paper bag.  However, you pay prices like going to Red Robin or some sit down place, and the quality is not that of a sit down place.  My suggestion is to go a block down to Trop. and have In-N-Out and pay a fraction of the price or go someplace where they don't yell out numbers for you to pick up your food.  For 3 people (2 adults and 1 child) we paid almost $40, at In-N-Out we usually pay about $20.  I don't mind these prices if I am not having to stand in line to order and getting my food in a paper bag and then sitting in hard metal and plastic chairs.  \n\nSo my advice save the money and go to another fast food place, or spend maybe $10 more and go someplace where you can sit and have your order taken and get the higher quality.",0

2792,0,"The Tap Haus is fine, but only fine. Not great, not horrid, but fine. It's one of the rare places in Madison that give me a very neutral opinion on its existence.\n\nUnless if a certain tap is on special, the beer is usually a bit too expensive there. Some of the taps run for $7 a pint, and considering that they serve a beer that costs $7 at Woodman's for a 6 pack, it certainly seems marked up. I think most of them are decent, a couple aren't so good, and a couple are dang good. But regardless, I think they prices on pints should be lower than they are by a little bit.\n\nAs for the food, I think that they have a good selection of appetizers at least. The pretzel is big, and comes on a hook, which is fun. The cheese curds are decent, the fries are decent, and the deep fried vegetables are good. There's a good selection of deep-fried stuff overall. The Sandwiches are just ok though. When I had the veggie sandwich and the grilled cheese, I just felt like it could've added a seasoning or extra ingredient to give it a better flavor. The chopped salads are also just ok. Not really too creative, but the ingredient quality is decent enough.\n\nThe space itself is fine too. A lot of seating, big booths, good decor, a decent number of tvs but none that are too large (which can be good or bad depending on the occasion). Overall, everything about the Tap Haus makes it a decent place, but rarely a destination spot. It's probably someplace to keep in mind if you're on the Capitol square and the Old Fashioned or Cooper's are looking too crowded.",0

This place shares many of the accolades you'll find at Puck's Bar & Grill in MGM, but falls a bit short of it's big brother in consistency, food quality, and service - The Pizzeria & Cucina, however, is still relatively green when compared to the Bar & Grill, and with time I would expect to see the P&C move into line with the B&G.\n\nThe P&C is a bit more casual than the B&G, and most of the other Puck establishments in Vegas.  Seating can be a bit slow at time, and the service is noticeably more casual and laid back than some of the other locations.  As you would imagine, the pizza here is top notch, and would be recommended.  The a large portion (if not all) of remained of the menu seems to be ported over from the Bar & Grill, however the execution is typically less consistent here.  The food is in no way bad, or even close to it, but the casual attitude in the front of the house seems to have found it's way back into the kitchen as well.  \n\nI should note that during my first visit here (with my parents), they mentioned I was a local, and the server gave up 20% off the check - it was a very nice touch.  While I am mentioning the bill, the Pizzeria is definitely a bit more affordable than the Bar & Grill, which is about the only advantage it has over it's big brother.\n\nThe bottom line: this is a great place to eat, but it's worth the extra walk up the strip to the Bar & Grill in MGM Grand; however, if you are too lazy, you will not be dissatisfied with the Pizzeria & Cucina.",2

I really don't like when businesses mix religion with their product, I think it's really annoying and offensive.

When broccoli and beef over rice was offered, take out orders simply were not portioned with enough food.  For a dish over $5, there should be more than two pieces of beef.  Items billed as hot sandwiches arrived cold, with cheese not even partially melted.\n\nAs this is a student run enterprise, let's hope that the Fall batch of students are more detail oriented and the quality improves!",0

The service it's not nonexistent it's pure rude like I borrowed money from them and didn't pay them back!! So every time I ask them about any dish on the menu they look at me like I was crazy, like I was from another planet or something for not knowing what I was asking about was. One time I was there for lunch at 2:30 or so with a buddy of mine and I asked them if I could order the happy hour dishes that starts at 3 and naturally they said no which was understandable so we order and started to eat til 2:57 when I asked again to get something from the happy hour menu the waitress looked at me with a look the a mom would give to her child when he did something bad and replied it's not 3 at that point I wanted to het up and leave  but my buddy said wait and at least finish lunch, ok I finished stood up and asked our waitress for a togo box from behinds the counter she the replied \""for what?\""....I was so done with this place told me buddy to pay and stormed out \n\nSo for all you awesome people that read the my whole rant thank you and those who didn't.....well I STRONGLY would not recommend this place to eat maybe to get pissed off at but other then that yeah that's my two cent.",0

Charlie Palmer's RW menu is pretty limited and the only portion of the meal that you can choose different options was the appetizer.\n\nHudson Valley Foie Gras Terrine (regular menu):\nNutella, raspberry spaghetti, black mission figs and Texas toast. The terrine was perfectly smooth and creamy which is why it worked so well with the Nutella.  The warm Texas toast just makes the terrine smoother and creamier.  The raspberry spaghetti lacked flavor - it added color to the plate and that's about it. The figs added texture. 4/5 \n\nAustralian Kobe Beef Carpaccio:\nCame with truffle salad. The salad would've been great had it not been extra salty.  The carpaccio itself was excellent...the salad ruined it! 3/5\n\nCharred Bone-In FIlet Mignon:\nCame with bone marrow flan and Port Wine reduction.  The bone marrow flan was good.

The gratin was delis and the melted parmesan on top was great. 4/5\n\nChocolate Peanut Butter Bar:\nServed with caramel ice cream, and chocolate sauce. I don't like peanut butter and chocolate together but that's just a matter of personal preference. The ice cream was good and I finished it then gave the friend the half of my peanut butter.  I mean, the peanut butter wasn't too bad since it wasn't really that pronounced - I was just not in love with it to finish it. 3/5\n\nThe night we went, there was an event (some business mixer) and no hostess was there so we were quite confused.

2821,0,"I wish I would have referred to Yelp first - what's wrong with me?  My only excuse is it was someone else's suggestion/desire to come here.  Does that help redeem me at all?!  :)\n\nI went here to meet former coworkers for lunch about a week ago and was quite impressed...at the MENU.  I'd heard mixed reviews about Cheddar's for quite some time, mainly concerning their slow service, so I was a bit skeptical.  But their surprisingly tasteful interior and impressive menu brought about hope.  I have to say, the impressiveness ends at the d\u00e9cor and the menu selections.  I said SELECTIONS.\n\nI had trouble making up my mind, so many things looked/sounded so tasty.  I settled on the chicken tenders & shrimp combo and a Caesar side salad.  I was impressed that my entr\u00e9e came with two sides - wasn't expecting that, especially not for $9.99.  I selected the \""southern style\"" green beans and baby carrots.   I must give credit where credit is due; the SIDE ITEMS were great.  But it ended there.  Neither the chicken nor the shrimp had any flavor to them whatsoever.  I was shocked.  I didn't even finish my chicken tenders because they didn't seem fully cooked to me.  The breading on them was very light in color, very flaky, and TASTELESS, as though it was nothing more than mere flour and maybe egg whites or buttermilk?  No seasoning at all.  Same with the shrimp.  Very blah to say the least.  And very disappointing.  \n\nService I must admit was much better than expected, although bordering on smothering.  Had a very young waiter that seemed to try way too hard to \""be there\"" for us and to try to be pleasant & friendly (was somewhat forced rather than genuine).  Started to get on my nerves (then again if you knew me, you'd know that when you begin getting smothery you're pushing my buttons big-time!).  However given the negative reviews I'd heard in the past regarding service, I'd rather have this than a non-existent server, so I quickly got over that.  He also didn't seem to be that familiar with the menu & its flexibility (ie: this can be subbed for that, etc), so that was a little bit of a turnoff to my dining companion.\n\nIn a nutshell University City has far too many dining options, so I wouldn't select Cheddar's again.  Even with commendable service, the food has to match, and this place just didn't work for me, not even a little.  I'd rather eat at Chick-Fil-A across the street!",2

2823,0,So so yogurt and with one on every corner you really have to make yourself stand out. I thought the kid behind the counter was friendly and helpful. The toppings and yogurt selections are once again so so. Does anyone else find it odd this business is categorized under Ethiopian food?,2
2824,0,"Summary: A great arrangement of mostly Asian influenced flavors that provides new takes on relatively familiar dishes. But what I also like about this place is allowing the texture of the food to stand out as much as the flavor. Here's what I mean:\n\nFor example, I don't usually order edamame at restaurants because they all taste the same, but here, the edamame was mixed with turmeric oil, ginger and togarashi (Japanese pepper spice) making it the BEST EDAMAME I've ever had. \n\nThe heirloom tomato salad with steak was PERFECT. I loved the use of thai basil. The balsamic vinegar was sweet without being overly acidic. The steak was so tender, we could cut it with the butter knife. \n\nThe charred bok choy was simple, crisp and refreshing.\n\nThe quinoa fried rice with sun-dried pineapple and baby(?) cilantro brought a classic fried rice concept with a new texture by using quinoa. \n\nI liked the tomato soup, the flavor came in three phases; first you taste sweetness, followed by the tomato acidity then a spicy kick after it passes the back of your tongue. I think there's chipotle in there providing the spicy aftertaste. But it was a little too sweet for me. \n\nWe came here for Saturday lunch, the bartender was super friendly, enthusiastic and outgoing. He made great recommendations and even offered to see if the kitchen could make dinner items that aren't on the lunch menu. \n\nI eat a lot of Asian/Oriental style meals (Japanese, Thai, Korean) weekly and Poppy Den is really something special. It does stand out for the reasons I mentioned in the first paragraph. \n\nI visit Summerlin/LV 1-2 times a year and I think Poppy Den will be one of my regular places to eat and enjoy life.",4

2826,0,"This is my hometown airport so it's hard to write a bad review (you know, local pride and all that). I fly in and out of McCarran a lot. It's a serviceable airport with fairly easy parking and decent services. It's an older airport so it shows its age, but since Vegas attracts tourists from all walks of life from all over the world, it's a great place to people watch between flights. My favorite is to watch when people get off a plane from, say, Newark, and then they head straight for the in-airport slot machines. Only in Vegas. The new Terminal 3 wing is super nice and shiny but lacks adequate seating (and the security lines can be ridiculously long). If you are traveling out of Terminal 3 you need to allow at least 30 more minutes than you think you need.",0

2828,0,"Visited the Rosehip on Sunday night for dinner. The place seemed relatively quiet when we arrived, we were sat by the window (to encourage passers by to enter).  Thankfully the heating was on full blast so this area was very cosy, however as the evening progressed it got busier and the new people were sat at the tables near us.  This would normally be fine, but we felt the tables were pretty close together, now in a confined space and it felt like everyone could listen in to each others conversation.  Became a little to cosy for my liking, especially since there was a large restaurant up the stairs at the back only half full. \n\nWe ordered burgers.  They arrived with nice big homemade wedges, coleslaw and the chicken burgers were big and all very filling.  All yummy but the white burger buns were a bit cheap tasting.  A seeded roll or more sturdy roll would have been better, the burger fell away from the hands and it was a bit messy.  \n\nPersonally prefer the Sea Dogs restaurant, who used to be sited here - gutted it closed!  Rosehip is trying and to gastro pub and restaurant dining, but I think they should stick to one or the other.",0

Needless to say, the food was spectacular as it had been the last 3 times we had been there.  I gave it 3 stars on this review due to the poor service.  We waited at least 10 minutes to have a server come to our table after we were seated with no apologies for the wait and that was after I went back to the hostess stand to ask where our server was.  She had indicated he was at the bar getting drinks....10 minutes!  Really!  Asked our server about the \""Foodie Friday\"" special and he did not seem to know what I was talking about but finally the light bulb went on and he said he had to check on it.  Waited a long time for our drinks to come out and another long wait for the food.  I will state again that the food has always been excellent and it was this time as well.  We ordered a slice of their Pina Colada cake to go and that took another 10 minutes.  I had already paid the check and we were just sitting there waiting for the cake to go box to come.  Poor, poor service and top that off with a waiter who seemed to be clueless and lacking in any sense of urgency....not a good combination.

I asked multiple people in the office and they had never seen anything like it.  Wish I could upload a picture. I usually eat there at least once a week so I tried to call and talk to a manager.  The phone was answered with please hold in an annoyed voice, followed by another person picking up the phone with a yeah.

2837,0,"After the success of Slider Trucks, its no surprise that more food trucks popped up. The Japanese inspired food truck delivers in creativity, but needs to work on execution. \n\nI went with the #1 Fuku Burger that costs $5. Its your traditional burger of tomatoes, lettuce, and onions, but with pickled garlic and their Fuku sauce. My first bite, I knew I wouldn't be a fan of it. First, the sauce drowned the entire burger, so you really couldn't taste anything else. The burger patty also had something in it, possibly the garlic that just obliterates the pallet where you can't even taste anything anymore. Lastly, they used a lot of salt, and I mean a lot of it. I'm not one to usually ding a place for using MSG or anything else that makes you thirsty, but I never EVER had to drink so much water after eating a meal. 4 full glasses of water last night and as I'm writing this review, drinking even more water. Ridiculous. \n\nFor mentioning Yelp, I got the free flavored ice mountain. Mine was really a mountain, I think it was taller than the Stratosphere. Regular price is $3, which is pricey for literally shaved ice and artificial food flavorings. There wasn't anything special about this, but anything cold in the hot Vegas summer would be good. \n\nI didn't get a chance to try the garlic fries because they ran out. Forgivable? Yes. However, its not a good sign especially for a grand opening.\n\nThe wait time for the food is similar to Slider Truck, but I would say Fuku is slightly faster. For a decent size line, expect a 5 minute wait. Then expect another 10 - 15 minutes for your food. Definitely not a place to grab a quick bite.\n\nAgain, I'll say the same thing as I did for Slider Truck as a suggestion for this place. Be considerate about how you communicate with your customers, whether its food shortages, locations, or any important information. Remember that not everyone has access to internet all the time. \n\nI give this place credit for being creative, but at the end of the day the food just didn't work. There is a lot of room for improvement and I'm willing to try this place again in the future if its around my area. Otherwise, its not worth driving and hunting for this place with so many other venerable burger places in town.",0

We ordered it medium rare and it was a little more on the rare side. Personally, a little under is always better than a little over. So, the temperature of the steak was fine, but it was really lacking in flavor :-(. It seemed like it needed more seasoning and for a ribeye it really just wasn't very juicy. And for a $40 steak, it should have knocked my socks off. However, the green beans we ordered as a side were very good. \n\nI could tell throughout our meal the server seemed a little rushed. He mentioned to us that he was also taking and running all of the room service orders. Having to do all the extra work was probably not his fault, after all everyone's got a job to do. Unfortunately, it caused his service to really lack for us. \n\nAll in all, we had a pleasant time but I do feel like a few things could have been just a bit better...especially for the ticket price we were left with. Unfortunately, we probably won't be back.",0

When I got home, they had charged me $95!!! for a pair of sneakers that was marked $18.99.  Im going in tomorrow to see if they will staigghten it out, but they are very hard core and I think I am out about $60.00 Read the slip!!",0

2846,0,I had the smothered chicken with mac and cheese and green beans.I can say it was worth the drive from Balyntyne suburbs to get some good ole southern cooking. i got there at 11:30am on a Wednesday... the lunch crowd has not even came in yet so I was 1 of the first customers I gave it a 3.5  star wish could have given it a 4 star mainly the it was too pricey for the amount of food given... A fair price for that plate should have been $7 tops.. I paid $10 an didnt get a drink with it.. Don't think I will be visiting this place anytime soon..,0
2847,0,"Pancake cafe has just about the best omelettes I've ever had.  Light & fluffy, with very flavorful vegetables and the right balance of cheese.  I also tried the sausage patty and it was delicious.  Fresh squeezed OJ, good ambience all around.  I'm a fan!",3
2848,0,"This seems to be a trend with Mandalay Bay and their promises. My friend and I went back to Mandalay Bay for the weekend as they promise to make things right the second time around. We had a trip to Arizona so we decided to stay in Las Vegas for one night and use the comp room they gaved us. We booked the room back in June and on Monday of the weekend we were heading out, I called in to confirm. I was garauntee that we would have the same type of room we had last time which was 2 queen size beds. When we checked in on Saturday after a 9 hour drive, they put put me in a king size room. I told the lady at the front desk that I was promised 2 queen size when I called to confirm. The only option I could have is either a 2 queen size room that was for smokers or a king size room with a roll out bed.I had no choice but to compromise and accept the king size bedroom.\nWe went up to floor 25 room 108. We checked the room and there was no left over food, bugs or power problem like the last time we visited. We just got back visiting antelope canyon in vegas so the first thing we did was to take a shower. While my friend was taking her shower, I turn on the tv and there was no signal. The tv is still an issue just like our last visit, only instead of it flikering from the power saving mode, it is not showing any channels at all. When my friend was done with her shower, she came out and informed me that the water in the shower wont go down and is basically flowing out of the shower. Angry, I called the front desk and told them what happened and they told me that they will send over a technician. I demanded to speak to a manager as I was really upset because nothing seems to had change from the last time I was here, even though they told me otherwise. I believe the manager I spoke to was name Susan, and I told her exactly what has happened. We were promised over the phone on Monday that we will get 2 queen size beds, the tv has no signal whatsover, and now theres a flood happening in the bathroom. While I was on the phone with her, I instructed my friends to head down first and use the $100 comp we had while I get our room issue fix. the option to use the $100 is very limited and we decided to use it on the noodle but they are way overprice and not good. $17 for wonton soup and $20ish for pad thai. the engineer came and pretty much snake into the drainage to clear up the clog. Both the engineer and the manager informed me that the tv losing signal is a known issue and would be resolved in a few hours. Like the front desk, she says the only thing she can do is to put us in a smoking optional room that has 2 queen beds. After 2 or 3 more minutes with her on the phone, she offered us to stay in a bigger suite free of charge as our current room are having issues. I agreed so long as she personally go to the suite she is moving us to and personally inspect it to make sure there is no more issues. She agreed and told me she will sent some1 to pick up our luggage. I waited by myself for 15-20 minutes before giving up and calling front desk in which they reply that some1 will be there shortly as they were delayed for a bit. the manager susan then personally came up to my room to hand me my new keys and inform me that she did do a check and everything is good to go.\nFinally got the luggage at the new suite at floor 28 room 108. Did a quick inspection and everything seems to check out. Another issued I had was after I have finish getting our bags to the new room, all my friends has finished eating and came back up, so I had basically stayed behind nearly half hour+ getting this issued fix. I was hungry, I was dirty from the desert, I was tired as i only slept 3 hours the last 48 hours. I finally went and took my shower but heres the worst part. i had closed the door to the bathroom door, turned around and as I was undressing, the bathroom door does not close and therefore, everyone on the bed was able to see me naked. I had to use a tower to wedge the door shut. After the shower, we head out, but because of how crapy i felt fromt his whole ordeal, I went back after an hour to rest up while the rest of my friend's continue to party without me. I went back to the front desk to complain and this time they brought another manager name Kristen. She said she will sent another engineer up to fix the door issue.the engineer came and fix the door. I went to sleep at 12 and my friends came back at 2. While they were getting ready for bed, both sink were clog. I was too tired at that point to complain again. Next morning, I checked out and ask to speak with Kristen again but she was already off duty. The manager there got my number and informed me that he will personally give her my number so she can contact me to work something out. That was 10am and when I got back home in Los Angeles at 9pm, no one has called me. i called back and Kristen informed me that no one informed her to call me back.this trip was by far the least enjoyable",0
2849,0,"I go to Anna's as you can't really beat the price for lunch.  Taste is ok.  If you go there for dinner, it is pretty empty and the prices are \""normal\"" prices.  I guess I probably would not go there again for dinner as I find there are much better places for dinner for about the same price. \n\nI think the service is mediocre, and what's more I dislike the owner.  I think she's a complete idiot and a snob.  Three times (twice by phone, and once in person) I would ask a question and get the wrong answer.   Very simple questions like, do they take a certain credit card, or like what time does the lunch special end?  She should not be answering the phones!  If the lunch prices weren't so cheap, I wouldn't go there.",0
2850,0,"went there for the first time for lunch today. The weekday lunch crowd is pretty big but the service is fast and friendly so they seem to turn tables over pretty quickly. \n\nMy table split an order of Hummus and I had the small order of cabbage leaves (ground lamb). The meal was fine, light and fresh tasting. I was surprised how inexpensive it was...less than $5. Would totally go back for another lunch run since I work in the area.",2
2851,0,The prime rib is not good. Not seasoned well. The service is decent but I barely started eating and the server brings the bill and never returned.,0
2852,0,"Went to Rudy's Saturday night and was really disappointed.  Ordered baby backs at 7:30 and they only had 4.  Said it would be 30 MINUTES before they had more.  Really, out of ribs at 7:30 on a Saturday night.  Might have been a blessing in disguise as they were TOUGH and minimal meat...did order 2 pork ribs and they were pretty good.  Otherwise, very disappointed in the food....",1
2853,0,"Honestly, this place was Eden to locals when it first opened. Nowadays it's super bro-like and bathrooms are filthy. Service is below average but the premises themselves are \""okay\"". \n\nThe games certainly make up for the lack of quality but I do wish the place was as awesome as it was when it first opened.",0
2854,0,Probably the most terrible customer support I have ever encountered. after being berated by the office manager over the substance of my call I was then told in other words to go to hell. I will NEVER receive services here.,0
2855,0,"Full Service? Not really.  Assigned Seating? Yes.  Fast Food style line? Yes.  Tipping? Yes - jar with a reminder phrase about how tipping isn't just for cows.  Also the credit card slips have the tip line on them, but yet again this is clearly not a full service place.  Interesting.\n\nThe awkwardness started when we couldn't enter the building yet there were many open tables visible, and no apparent overcrowding inside.  They have a corral that starts outside with staff only allowing patrons in to where you find yourself paying for the 1st of multiple times - the first is a separate transaction in a standing line for your beer.  And sadly there are only Arizona beers on draft and the large size is only available in a big FROZEN schooner that you often see at old school Mexican restaurants.  After paying for the first time you continue through the line where another staff member gives you an assignment slip for your table.  Better not lose that!  And then you order at the register, pay a 2nd time, and proceed to find your assigned seat.  In my case it was 2 burgers, 2 fries for low $30's (excluding tip and excluding beer).  Shortly after this I found my beer glass empty and guess what - you must go back to the bar or find a roaming employee in your assigned seating area.  So make that a 3rd transaction for my visit.  I'm not making this stuff up.\n\nWhen I thought it couldn't get much worse before I had even received my food I made the mistake of getting a nice tall glass of water from the unlabeled water dispenser which turned out to have cucumber and citrus juices in it too.  If you don't dig cucumbers, you understand the surprise.  But to make me feel better, I noticed all of the signs espousing the \""support local\"" philosophy/religion and such, and for that reason I can see why they'll gain a lot of similarly minded consumers.   \n\nFood quality was in fact fairly good as far as burgers go and reminded me a lot of Smashburger, but then the inevitable comparisons of how they run the business came to mind.  \n\nIn the end I find myself leaning in one of two separate directions. If I'm going to dish out this much money for burgers and beers I'd rather just be at a full service place.  Or, if I'm going to be corralled into standing lines and such then maybe I'd rather just be at a Smashburger-like place where the food is just as good but without the big dent in my wallet.",2
2856,0,I was not impressed. Food quality was low and tasted cheap. I have no idea why ppl rave about it. I won't go back. Liberty is across the parking lot and a thousand times better plus they use local food.,0
2857,0,"We absolutely LOVED Carlsbad Tavern! We weren't sure what to expect by the name, but we were pleasantly surprised when we walked in. It was late in the evening and we sat on the patio, which has a really cool ambience with the fireplace, palm trees and water features. We enjoyed a few cocktails from the Late Night menu, and at the suggestion of our server, we ordered the New Mexican pot stickers. All I can say is they were amazing. The sauce was so good, I could've seriously licked the plate clean if I knew no one was watching! (Lol) The only downfall is that we found this place on the LAST night of our vacation, otherwise we would've been back at least one more time. The atmosphere, service and food here is simply outstanding. Try this place, you won't be disappointed!!!",4
2858,0,The sushi was delicious. The other food didn't compare. If I go back here I would just stick with the sushi. The waitress and other employees were very attentive. Nice atmosphere.,3
2859,0,"My friend found this small Moroccan grocery and invited me to stop by for dinner. The interior consists of a grocery and clothing section, and a tiny dining area. There was not much of ambiance as we were the only visitors on that evening. It's a one-person operation and the owner does everything from kitchen to the floor. \n\nThe Harira ($3.99) came with lentils, tomatoes, garbanzo beans and cilantro soup. The blend of ingredients and spices made it zesty hearty with a good lift stemming from a mix of lentil and cilantro. It was a light opener and one item to consider for those looking for soups. \n\nThe Baba Ghannouge ($4.99) came with baked eggplant, sesame sauce, garlic, and lemon. The thick eggplant consistency was garlicky and addictive. The zesty lemony flavor nicely intertwined with the deepening sesame sauce. However, the bursts of eggplant flavors were held in check and in need to be more striking.\n\nThe Bamiah ($12.99) was put together with a large bulky piece of simmered lamb, saffron, okra, and a combination of spices. The okra was very tasty and nicely stewed. The outer-layer of the lamb had some dry spots, but otherwise it was tender and easy to fork into. The mix of spices could also be more intense and integrated. It was missing one note that could have brought it all together. \n\nThe Goat Tagine ($14.99) was culminated by a large bulky piece of goat with the bone in, saffron, and spices. The goat too, had some dry spots on the outside, but it was still very tender and easy to fork into. The aroma was sensational, but I wished the goat were seasoned better.\n\nOverall, the food was solid but not spectacular. There were some minor wow factors stemming from the soup and the wonder aroma of meat and spices. Despite the missing notes that could serve as a bridge between the meat and broth, but the drizzles were still very tasty when served on top of our generous servings of rice. \n\nService was very personable and friendly. It goes without saying, but the one-person operation will cause the food to take some time to arrive. I'd be very interested in coming back to try their good-looking Bastilla.",2
2860,0,"I am going to start off by just stating that this place is hit-or-miss.  I've been here before for events and had a great time.  Everyone loves the cocktails and the bartender KNOWS his tequilas.  I've never really sat down for serious eating here until two days ago.  I waited 48 hours to write this and I still can't shake feeling ripped off.  \n\nI generally shrug off service issues.  La Comida is a hip place in a currently hip part of town.  I'm not there for Zagat rated service.  But in a restaurant a quarter full, we shouldn't have had to wait 10 minutes for a server. This set the stage. We asked about any specials, but the server told us they are listed on the menu. I then pointed out those were SPECIALTIES, do they have any daily specials? I then told him in Spanish. He got it, laughed and said no.  Pretty matter of fact, but on top of a ten minute wait, not appreciated.\n \nI ordered the shrimp ceviche. My date the chicken burrito.  My \""dinner\"" came back a little cup of miniature shrimp, no bigger than a dime, on top of some diced fruits and avocado. It looked and tasted like half of the serving you get in a 99 cent shrimp cocktail in sundae glass up the block the California Hotel on Fremont Street.  Worse? It tasted like it! I couldn't believe it. The way it was described by the waiter, it seemed it would at least be in league with similar restaurants.  This couldn't even hold a candle to Applebee's.  This dish was $12 and it couldn't have cost them more than a quarter to make.  I was livid, but on a date, so just smiled....and drank my warm Modelo.\n\nMy date fared better. The chicken burrito had a chewy tortilla wrap, but the chicken was good and somewhat ample.  It was also kind of pricy at 12 bucks, but could tolerate it because was more than a cup of miniature brine shrimp at the same price. My date's Modelo was also warm (but we were told they were supposed to be like that by the waiter. OLE')\n\nBottom line...this is a destination restaurant more for taking selfies with drinks in hand than actually eating food.  I don't think the owners, Jenna and Michael Morton, who are renowned for creating dining experiences, are probably even privy to this kind of spotty food and service going on.  I'm hoping they are not.  But if it's really good food you want for the money, I'd say have a drink here first and move on.",0
2861,0,"I couldn't see what people are raving about this place? Oh I take it back. Perhaps it's the crazy portion of the banana split? Or the fudge sundae. Otherwise, it would just be a regular diner's style treats. We waited too long for a table and didn't have any good memory of it. 1 star goes for the cool venue in Caesars Palace, and the other star goes to the cool looking menu.",2
2862,0,"Was super excited to eat here. Was greeted by the owner and he mentioned the  2 taco  special with a side of rice and refried beans (pinto or black) and a drink. Thought it would be a great way to try out the food and opted to eat at the restaurant. It took a very long time for my order to be ready and people that placed orders to go received their food before I did. The beans were spicy and seemed to have been flavored with chorizo, wish I had know that before ordering, not a fan of chorizo. The rice was a bit dry and bland. Like mentioned in previous reviews the portions were small. The tacos looked delicious. To my disappointment the al pastor was dry, over salted, and there were a lots of pieces of fat. The chicken alambre  taco was flavorful but the corn tortilla kept breaking apart, it was uncooked. Overall, for the food was nothing special and since I didn't care for the rice, beans or al pastor it was not a good deal.Reaffirms that making the drive to Tacos el Gordo is definitively worth it, delicious authentic tacos, inexpensive, and worth the wait!",1

2867,0,"Very good new restaurant right off the square.  Our party of 4 tried several dishes and all of us were very happy with the food and generous portion sizes.  They even modified one of the entrees (the Korean \""sushi\"")  for us to share as an appetizer and substituted a kimchi plate instead of the soup (we did not ask for it and were pleasantly surprised).   Would recommend asking for your Bibimbap in a stone bowl - really ads a lot to the dish with the crispy rice bits in the bottom.  looking forward to going back soon, my husband and I are fighting over his BBQ pork leftovers!",3
2868,0,"I made a reservation for a full-size car for 6 days. My husband is tall (6'8\"") so I knew we wouldn't be comfortable in a mid-size or smaller. I was happy to pay for the full-size and was happy with my quote of $166.70.\n\nWhen we arrived at the Las Vegas location at 9pm on a Wednesday night (in the middle of what our cab driver called \""the dead season\""), we were told there were NO full-size cars available. NONE!? None. \n\nThe rental agent offered us a \""discount\"" on an upgrade. We had budgeted our mileage into our trip (a 1,250-mile roadtrip to four national parks), so changing from our anticipated full-size car to an SUV, van or luxury sedan was going to be a big cost already. \n\nOur rental agent told us the Chrysler 300 got 31 mph (highway). Since we had few options, we went with that one. And paid $276 for the six days ($110 more than expected). The car's mileage was NOT 31 mph and was closer to 24 mph. \n\nI feel very manipulated and deceived. I know bait-and-switch is common for those renting sub-compact cars, but I thought we'd be safe renting a full-size. I know other cars were available (the lot was FULL of cars, but we were told they were either not technically 'full-size' or weren't 'ready to be rented') and feel like they basically reached into my pocket and stole a hundred dollar bill. \n\nThe location is a huge pain-in-the-@ss, too.

What the heck is that?  They couldn't call me when they heard from the insurance or did they just come up with an excuse.

It's quite a drive from my office, but my taste buds always thank me when I finish my lunch.\n\nThis place is not cheap, it cost me $11.59 for a Brisket Sandwich combo that included a side of coleslaw and a drink. I think that the brisket is very tasty and I prefer it over the pulled pork. Currently, those are the only two items I have tried to date. The coleslaw was good, but not KFC good. I have had the beans and I thought they were decent. The fries have a little too much cayenne pepper or some similar type spice on them in my opinion.

2875,0,When this store opened in 1998 it was clean and had good clientele. Now it's dirty and overcrowded. A lot of garbage people shop there. I always see people getting purses stolen inside and out of store. I feel this store is unsafe. I think the dynamics of the neighborhood have changed. I will shop elsewhere and pay more for my own safety. Walmart also is non union and pays their employees low wages and doesn't give them good benefits. They are a greedy company based out of Arkansas that pushes made in USA and everything is made in china from slave labor. Walmart is from Arkansas and has their mentality. Exploit people and keep them down. I won't frequent SAMs club that is owned by walmart. I would rather pay a little more for products at companies that care about their employees and customers.,0

2877,0,"I need to preface my review by saying that Nike owned stores are not for everyone. If you want a bargain, don't waste your time. This is not an outlet store. If you're into sneaker culture and shoes are a vice of yours, you will come away satisfied. It's nice to be able to get access to the limited edition Nike releases at a legit source. \n\nWhile the store isn't large, they manage to hit the areas most people want: basketball, running, golf, baseball, tennis, and crosstraining.\n\nAbout my only negative is that they don't have anything for soccer or football. Since Nike makes so many team uniforms for European soccer teams and will soon take over the NFL jerseys, it would be nice to see some of that product there in the future. \n\nAll in all, I love this place and plan on blowing plenty of my disposable income in the future there.",2

2883,0,"I was wandering around the shopping center at Shea and Scottsdale Road at lunch trying to decide what to eat.  I noticed a little Italian Deli, and was amazed  - it was before noon and the placed was packed.  I went in and before I looked at the menu, I wandered around looking at the diners and their plates.  The diners were very mixed - professionals,  construction workers, couples, singles, and groups. They all seemed to have something different, and they all seemed to be enjoying what they were eating.  \n\nSo I decided to give it a try.  The person who took my order spoke heavily accented Italian, but I managed to convey what I wanted, which was really simple - an Italian Sub with salami, Mortadella, Pepperoni & Provolone.  It was packed with onions, tomatoes, and lettuce, and drenched in sub oil.  It was great, delicious - made me aware of what I had been missing all my life - and more than filled me up.\n\nMy only disappointment was that I was full - I wanted to try everything on their menu, because everything looked so tempting.  But they are close to my home, so I'm sure it will become my lunchtime favorite.\n\nI only gave them 4 stars, since I only had the sandwich.  But I will update as I visit them again and try their complete menu, which also includes salads, pasta, pizza, and different kinds of subs.",2

2887,0,"Heck yeah!\nTalk about the system working!\nProps to Matt who started the awesome thread on Yelp Madison Talk re: openings and closings (http://www.yelp.com/topic/madison-the-official-2013-madison-openings-and-closings-comings-and-goings-thread) and thanks to Steve for letting the community know about this new Indian joint on Junction Rd. (It may have taken me a few months to get her otherwise!) I was bouncing around the threads last night, saw \""Indian\"" and got in the car. (I called on my way to make sure they were actually open.)\n\nFolks, this is easily the best Indian food I've found in Madison for three reasons:\n\n1. The Menu... holy cow, IT'S HUGE! I went for dinner and spent forever pouring over each and every page, looking up a few items on my phone because they were new to me. No shortage of variety here.   \n\n2. The Dosas... this and this alone should make you speed over. I think they have 15! That's nuts... NUTS! I'm used to seeing maybe 3 or 4 different kinds at a place.\n\n3. The Flavor... everything I tried was incredible. And although spice/heat is key to Indian cooking, theirs is well balanced, and not so hot that you can't taste anything. \n\nI had vegetable jalfrezi, chicken tikka masala, masala dosa and garlic naan. All of it was awesome! (GET THESE THINGS!) Even the garlic naan, which I sort of feel like is tough to make incredible, but it was incredible. It arrived at the table piping hot and aromatic and didn't have an offensive garlic flavor. The chicken tikka masala was some of the best I've had, topping some of the curry I long for in London. The veggies were tender yet crisp and in a super tasty sauce. And the dosa. Ohhhh the dosa. It was good, not my favorite, but with so many options, I can't wait to get back and try another one... maybe more adventurous than this one. \n\nHuge props to the stellar staff that made sure we had no questions about the menu, kept water glasses full, and told us they will have beer/wine/liquor soon. (Just wrapping up some paperwork.) They also sent us home with leftovers in boxes and gave us extra rice. Very kind. \n\nThe atmosphere ain't much, so don't go expecting to be transported to India or anything. There is some nice stuff hand painted on one wall, but that's about it. Small space. Bright light. No tunes playing the night I was there. I didn't notice construction dirt or dust so I'm guessing they cleaned up after what sounds like a rushed opening. And my feeling has always been, if I'm there the first week, I'm going to make a few exceptions anyway knowing they're still trying to find their footing. These guys have though. And if food remains consistent, this will be my go to for Indian stuffs in Madison!",4
2888,0,"Let's be honest, I was probably asking for it when I didn't bother to check Yelp before eating at this place. I got a Garlic Lime Steak Burrito Bowl and it was one of the worst things that I've had in my life. It SEVERELY lacked flavor to the point where everything kind of just tasted like a pile of mush with beans drowning all the odd flavors out. For something that's \""gourmet\"" and more expensive than chipotle I expected it to at least match it... Nope, the portions were small and the food was borderline disgusting. Garlic lime is just a sauce that they drizzle on the food...contrary to what their menu advertises. Do yourself a favor and just go eat at Einstein bros like I should have.",0

2890,0,"I really wanted to see \""How To Train Your Dragon II\"" and the iPic didn't have a showing. Wanting a similar experience, my husband and I decided to try Studio Movie Grill. Since I had never been to SMG previously, I had to rely on Yelp reviews in determining the best seats. After my decision was made, I went online and ordered tickets the day before. When I made my purchase, it appeared that only two other seats that were taken. I was under the assumption that the theater would be dead.\n\nWhen we arrived the day of the show that was the complete opposite. The parking lot, the entrance, and the actual theater were bustling. Families were waiting in the lobby, eating food, and having a good time. Inside the theater, we found our seats and found ourselves trapped between two different families and their children. (Yes, I realize we went to see what is generally thought of as a \""kid's movie\"".)\n\nAs the previews played, my husband looked at the menu and decided on ordering food. When no waiter came by to take our order, he pressed the red button and within 5 minutes a waiter showed up. We both ordered water and my husband ordered the coconut chicken/shrimp lunch option. Our waters arrived just as the movie had begun playing and about 15 minutes into the movie the food arrived. \nThe food was okay - nothing special. Average French fries - some were crispy other were limp. The chicken was okay and I didn't try the shrimp. My husband agreed everything was just okay. When we were finished, the dishes sat a while before a waiter came by with the check and took away the dishes. \n\nOverall, SMG pales in comparison to the iPic on all fronts. Yes, it is a slight upgrade from \""regular\"" theaters and it's nice you can order food instead of the standard popcorn and such. However, they have this funky setup inside the theater. The rows alternate between two distinctly different types of seating. One row is an elongated desk with office chairs (literally office chairs). The next row contains seats that have trays that swivel in front and to the side. (The material is similar to the leather of office chairs as well.) These chairs did not lean back and were a little disappointing. Needless to say, we did not sit at the desk/office chair row and I didn't see any other folks sitting there as well. I think SMG needs to rethink this and replace those rows with more comfortable seating.\n\nThe only other thing this place has going for it is the location. It's relatively close to my work/home and has ample parking. Plus, there are several over restaurants nearby in case you are hungry before/after a show. \n\nI can't say I will definitely be back but it's an option. I like having options.",2
2891,0,"This super famous Thai restaurant has been called the best Thai restaurant in the country.  I've been here quite a few times and the most important advice I have is to skip the buffet (don't even look at it or you'll be tempted) and order off the Northern Thai menu.  I recently had the Nam Kao Tod as appetizer-crispy rice noodles with some kind of delicious meat mixed in with the noodles.  My entr\u00e9e was Kho Soy  (Steak Tar Tar), which was flavorful and delicious.  My wife had the Kho Soi (Northern Thai egg noodles with Spare Ribs).  This restaurant is consistently delicious and there are many other items I am looking forward to trying on their Northern Thai menu.  The service is always helpful and the prices are reasonable.  My only complaint with Lotus of Siam is they recently quit accepting American Express, which is the only card I like to use in restaurants.

2896,0,"I live less than 2 miles from here and was really hoping it would be a good neighborhood bbq joint. The staff appeared to be new to the food serving industry, but they tried to be friendly and were mostly successful. Man, I hate to be critical of places, especially new small business trying to make it but.. When I go to a smokehouse bbq place, I almost always ask what kind of wood they use since I sell smoking wood chips as part of my business. Problem here was I could barely smell any smoke. This was an immediate worry. The first two people I asked didn't have a clue what wood they used- What?? Note to owner: Teach staff what wood you use, it is a fairly big part of the smoking process. I ordered the pulled pork with beans and mac n cheese. The pork sandwich was a decent portion, however, as suspected, there was not much smoke flavor at all. Now you can definitely go too far the other way and ruin good meat by smoking it too long, but a decent chef should know what he is doing. The meat was actually mushy as if it were being held in a vat of juice or water. Not the way to do it. The sides were all of 2 bites each. the beans were ho hum and the mac and cheese was made with joint compound it was so pasty!  These are such easy mistakes to overcome, they need not be. Give people decent food and decent service and they will love you. Try to cut corners, forget it. Sometimes experiences sound horrible only because they were simply disappointing.",0
2897,0,"I came here during my stay in Scottsdale for work on a Sunday night. It happened to coincide with Spring Training so I was told that all the restaurants were much busier than usual. This is probably the reason that despite the many empty tables both inside and outside (they were all filled by the time I left), I was told there was only availability for one at the bar or area in front of the kitchen. I opted for the kitchen area and got to watch the cooks at work during my dinner. \n\nThe atmosphere is very chic, but the patrons were a eclectic mix of retirees, families and young partiers. The concept is Mediterranean, although I didn't see any traditionally Mediterranean dishes on the menu. The menu is pretty sizable with a variety of pasta, fish, and meats to select from, with vegetarian and gluten-free options marked.  \n\nFOOD:\nPROSCIUTTO CRUDO FLATBREAD (topped with rosemary potato and soft egg) - When I ordered this, I didn't realize the portion was supposed to be shared so it ended up being way too much for me. If I had just one slice, it would've been great, but it got tiring after my third slice.\n\nBIG EYE TUNA (with charred scallions, snap peas, couscous & miso caramel) - I'm a sucker for couscous! I always order it when I see it on the menu so this selection was a no-brainer. The couscous and the snap peas did not disappoint. The Ahi Tuna was sesame seed crusted and was fine, but not mind-blowing. I wish it were marinated more to give it extra flavor.\n \nThe reason I rated this as 3 stars is simply because while the food was good, nothing was that impressive, especially for the price. Maybe if I came back and tried a few more items and drinks I would change my mind, but for now, this is just an OK restaurant.\n\nI would still recommend this restaurants for groups because I think their outside patio area is lovely. The menu is also diverse and safe enough that everyone should be able to find something they enjoy. However, definitely make a reservation, otherwise you'll be stuck at the bar like me!",3

2904,0,"This is one of those restaurant ratings that makes me question the palate of some yelpers.  I'm quite the food snob, and a bit of an amateur gourmet cook (make my own pastas/sauces/breads/ice creams), so if I eat out, the food should best my abilities in some way.  This place simply did not live up to anything near its 5 star yelp rating in any dimension other than its excellent service.  Let me say that again:  Service was excellent.  Waitstaff was very attentive, and the owner was extremely friendly as well.  5 stars for this part of the experience.\n\nNow the food.  The prices struck me as being too low for the area.  $26 for filet/$17 for homemade pasta seemed cheap to my eyes for dinner.  Turns out I was right.  I'd bet a fair amount of $$ that this place started with the best intentions and good quality ingredients, but the owner has cut prices and ingredient quality because he cannot figure out what's wrong with the restaurant given such high yelp reviews but poor customer turnout (Place was very quiet on a Saturday night at 8pm in spite of a great jazz band.).  \n\nCase in point:  my girlfriend's filet was nowhere near a USDA prime or even a choice cut.  I'd guess it was a select cut or a 'no roll' piece of meat similar to what's used at a chain steakhouse.  On top of that, the steak wasn't seasoned at all--no salt or fresh pepper.  It was dreadful.\n\nI ordered the citrus \""prawns\"" and lobster ravioli.  The prawns were clearly shrimp, and not even big shrimp:  I'd guess they were 15/20 shrimp at best; nowhere near 10/15 shrimp, and they were definitely not prawns.  Shrimp were also overcooked and flavorless and were cooked via boiling water rather than seared a la minute.  Ravioli texture was great, but filling was mediocre.  Sauce was OK, but didn't seem to be thickened via a typical method (butter or cream).  My guess is that the sauces are premade in the morning and they found butter-thickened sauces would break on them.\n\nCalamari appetizer was not seasoned, was bland, and overcooked.  Calamari were chewy and the tomato sauce served to accompany it was meh.\n\nAll in all, the relatively cheap food prices + poor quality of ingredients + shrimp masquerading as \""prawns\"" in my dish convinced me the owner probably started with very high ingredient quality and higher prices, but has lowered his price point and ingredient quality to try to spur demand.  I'm guessing he didn't do well, though, even with the best ingredients because the chef in the kitchen clearly isn't the best and doesn't know how to season food.  Nothing I ate had even a modicum of salt on it.\n\nIf the owner fired the chef and brought in someone new, raised the prices and the ingredient quality, he'd have a winning establishment.  I only hope he reads this review because it's clear he's trying his best, is a very affable fellow, and I genuinely want him to succeed.",0

2915,0,"Like Ellie Goulding's song \""Lights,\"" Greek food never gets old to me.  On any given day falafels and gyros can keep calling, calling, calling me to lunch or dinner.   Been wanting to try out Great Greek for a while, but it's a little more east than I usually travel.   Tonight I found myself in the area and decided to call in some takeout.  I went with a lamb gyro with feta fries on the side, and asked for a side of falafel because I simply have to try some at every Greek restaurant I go to because it's in the title of my list here on Yelp for Mediterranean eats.  When I arrived the food was ready and waiting for me and I was happy to see Dr. Pepper on the list of fountain drink options because as you may know, Dr. Pepper is the unofficial non-alcoholic nectar of the Gods.  \n\nI did have to drive about 20 minutes until I got home, so please take that into consideration for the food review that follows.  I immediately went for some feta fries which were pretty standard french fries covered in, you guessed it, feta cheese.  Because of the drive, the feta cheese had sort of started to congeal a little, but it had no effect on the taste and I found them delicious.   I will say for a quick comparison that I do prefer Yanni's Gyros fries where he adds garlic, feta and hot sauce, but I digress.  Then came the gyro.  With the first bite I knew it was something special.  Tender, flavorful gyro meat with the standard lettuce tomato and onion SMOTHERED in tzatziki and feta.   I think it had more of these two ingredients than any gyro I've had elsewhere, and to me that was a good thing.  Between the fries and the gyro the meal was fetariffic!  Sorry about that.  Lastly I tried some of the side of falafel, and was a little disappointed in those.  They weren't bad by any means, but I feel like I've had better in many places like Hedary's and the Fat Greek for example.  The texture was good, but it just wasn't as flavorful as I like.\n\nPrices were reasonable and service was friendly and efficient.  If Great Greek were closer to my work or home I'd make it a regular visit, but for now it will remain a solid choice when I'm in the area (which is almost never.

2921,0,"'Thank you Yelpers for giving me Zaytoon as a recommended restaurant.\nWe had lunch there today to give it a try.  I had the falafel sandwich with a side order of Tabouleah salad and my friend had the lamb kabob wrap.\nThe falafel was moist and well garnished with lettuce, tomatoes and onions. The tandoori bread was awesome.  It came with a side of what seems to be avocado mixed with humus (at least that's what my taste buds said).  The lamb kabobs were perfectly cooked and generous.  \nI checked out the bathroom and it was very clean.  The whole atmosphere is clean and tidy and the owner/ staff were very welcoming.  I will be back 'to try something different.  and... the prices are very reasonable ($4.99 for falafel and 8.99 for the lamb.) Don't miss this place.",3

2923,0,"I am sttill struggling to find sushi that compares with Zushi Puzzle or Sushi Bistro in San Francisco or with my all time favorite, Sansei in Maui.  I was optimistic about this place based on reviews, but it really is just average.\n\nThe atmosphere is pretty good, nice and clean, makes an effort at seeming Japanese.  Portions were very large and we did over order.  Nigiri was fresh.  The waitress either got our order wrong or the shrimp tempura roll looked and tasted like eel and the spicy tuna roll was not spicy.  When asked, she insisted that the plan tuna roll was actually a spicy tuna roll.  It didn't make sense because spicy tuna was delivered as part of the hand roll special and that was actually quite good?   The Eel tempura roll was quite tasty.\n\nI hate fake crab...its bad enough in a California roll, but horrible in a hand roll special, I mean why bother?  All the special rolls are just variations on California Rolls (again, with the fake crab).  I like a combination of nigiri and rolls, but there's just not a lot of imagination here.\n\nIced green tea was very yummy.\n\nMay or may not go back...still searching....",0
2924,0,"Ugh, this food is horrible. How can so many people like this place?!?!?! Went to dim sum here on a saturday morning and it was very empty. There were only about 3 carts going around and only went around ONCE.  I had to ask someone to come over and help us, but they only ended up bringing a specific plate over than the carts again. Oily stomach lining, slippery wontons....I feel like vomiting just writing about it.",0
2925,0,"Since I wasn't there for very long, this is a review in progress I guess you could say.. I seemingly take a trip to Vegas each year, so next time in town I will hit up Rio and give it another try  =\n\n~The Good~\nRio is off of the main part of the strip, so  it has a feel of being its own animal, I guess you could say. I haven't eaten at any of the restaurants, but the variety of options is perfect, from Caribbean fare to fine seafood, then they have this fun looking Indian food place as we walked in...Best of many worlds if you ask me. Gambling hall looks spacious and spread out evenly, and the events center which we saw Penn & Teller at was large, had a Starbucks for those coffee lovers, and a large lobby for all patrons with a bar. They have some drink stations as well, like Last Call for those whom like the slushy drinks. I was not in for very long, but I love island-themed resorts, so this place looks slick and worth a try again.\n\n~The Bad~\nI did notice that the pool was small, looked extremely small, actually. So I must have been seeing a side pool, I am sure....otherwise that is the smallest damn pool, why would a Caribbean-themed casino have a rinky-dink pool? Hrmm... The parking lot was also crazy; the structure had no room for our car, which forced us to park in the overflow lot.  I did not mind walking, but it was annoying having to drive around to an overflow lot... Also, the place did not smell overly inviting, not sure if it was the cigarette smoke or the cigarette smoke... Blech.  Also, just as it is off the strip which is nice, it is also difficult getting to all the other action. It would be difficult for me to have to drive to the strip each time I want to go down there, a lot of work.\n\n~The Down low~\nOverall, this place is fun. I was not able to enjoy it and take the entire place in on my trip there, mainly because we had the show to catch. Next time in Vegas, I will try to venture back and view more the casino has to offer. I will try to verify the pool situation, and see if parking ever gets better...until then they will get a generic 3 stars...But that should change :-0",0
2926,0,"Better than average fresh-Mex food.\n\nI like their chips and salsa bar, but none of their salsas are phenomenal, just mediocre.  Their food is kinda bland and lacks flavor and their plates are a little on the small side..... not enough beans / rice.  Their prices are decent.  If you're thinking Chipotle or Rubio's or some crap like that, you'd be better off here, but that's not saying much.",2
2927,0,"Maybe it was an off night?  This is the worst review I have given.  It is my Son's 26th birthday today so we met up with him at Brat Haus.  I had a really good feeling about this place due to it's current star rating on Yelp and the way it is designed.  It  has a really cool vibe.  The service and food were not acceptable.  The Scottsdale market demands good food and this place is not making the cut. My son ordered a Chorizo Dog and he sent it back (no flavor). My wife and I split a burger and they did not ask how I wanted it cooked. The burger arrived and it was well done and the only flavor I could taste in it was a strong taste of pepper?  It was horrible, I am sure they cook it to death because the quality of the beef won't allow them to cook it on the rare side.\n\nI did not drink but we had plenty of beer lovers at the table who were ready to have a beer or two but they had a hard time getting a server to stop by and take their order.  \n\nI tried some of the other's food and the only thing I found to be tasty was the pretzel fundido.  Not sure I will try Brat Haus again.",0
2928,0,4 stars just for the face this joint as frozen margarita's and beers for 2.00!!  \nThat alone is 4 stars.  didnt eat but sat at the bar alone with a few drinks.  Nice bartender.  will go back again when in town.  hard to find 2.00 drinks on the strip!,3
2929,0,"I've only been to this Ra once or twice, but I think the price is overestimated here.  Maybe people are having too much Sake.  The service is decent, ambiance is very faux Japanese-American deal.  Sushi is pretty good and if you go during happy hour it's a steal.  Sake and Kirin is like 3 or 4 bucks and you can get a thing of Sake for $1.  They have a nice patio sitting area to people watch. Great place if you want to catch a friend for lunch or do dinner and a movie.",3

Once I do...I'll let ya know!\n\nWe had a slew of folks that helped bring drinks, chips, salsa and everything else that we needed. I was pretty impressed with the level of service we received. \n\nThe ONLY downfall is not having an Italian dressing that's not creamy. No one likes creamy dressing. Please get a true vinaigrette  on your menu. I loved your taco salad but didn't have a good dressing to put on it. I promise to add this to my roatation if you do.",0

The coffee is strong and made with such flavor that you just can't compare it to Starbucks. Their staff is helpful and know how to make coffee. The atmosphere is relaxed and allows for kids to play around without knocking stuff over.\n\nMy wife and I are definitely impressed and are loyal to this local business!",3
2935,0,This place recently re-opened after being closed for a little while. My family and I decided to order some pizza's for dinner. Just awful!  Worst mistake ever. BIG BIG disappointment.

Sweaty ones.  Gross.",0
2937,0,"I have to admit, the only thing that makes this place good is their interesting looking bread, which is unique in appearance and texture and is delicious. Other than that, the sandwiches are pretty plain and expensive for what you get ($5-6 for a small sandwich). \n\nThe service here is pretty lackluster, since there are only a couple people working at any given time. When I've been here, I've found the cashier to be a little impatient when customers are trying to figure out what to order, so now I tend to just hit the drive thru. \n\nThe building is super old and parking is tight since there aren't very many spots out front. There's another small parking area in the back but it's not much larger. I usually get the small original, which is good, but like I said...only because the bread is unique, fresh and tasty. If they used baugettes or \""normal\"" sub bread for their sandwiches, I don't think I would eat here.",0
2938,0,"This course is fine to play, however we have experienced two issues that need mentioning.  \n\nFirst, one of our foursome recently had his first ever hole in one here at Silverado.  After the round, we mentioned the feat in the pro shop - and you could have heard a pin drop.  No fanfare whatsoever.  Other courses generally offer to take the information down for publicity purposes - or at least offer hearty congrats - but not here.  \n\nSecond, I recently attempted to make a reservation using a 2-rounds-of-golf certificate I had won at a local golf tournament.  The head pro answered my call to the course, and advised me that the course was closed for two weeks for overseeding.  My certificate expired in one week, so I asked if he could honor it right after the course reopened.  You guessed the answer .  .  . . . . .\""No.\""\n\nSo it will be a long thime before my shadow again graces this particular course.",0
2939,0,"Finally had a chance to try this place after a year driving by it. Glad I did! had their Philly Cheese steak. Meat was a good quality sliced very thin.

On a frosty December Sunday, we entertained the parentals as a pre-Christmas treat. I haven't been to too many gastropubs recently, but for me, this fitted the bill. Reasonable prices (2 courses for 15 quid), stonking portions (actually, too big even for greedy guts in the corner) and all rather tasty and locally sourced. Good solid food, why can't everyone make food like this? Parents happy with father, ill at the time, even managing to pack away three courses. Only note is that the SR felt the lamb shank he had was lacking in flavour, whereas I found the vegetarian dishes rather over salted. But, The Sun has me hankering to return. \n\nA little out of the way, but a perfect Sunday hangout.",2

2944,0,"If I could give no stars I would. This is the absolute worst company I have ever dealt with. Their billing is so messed up. I am supposed to be price locked (meaning I signed a 2 year agreement with them for $120/month) in with them and every couple of months I get a bill that is $30 to $40 higher. I have to call them and argue with them about them. It's ridiculous.\nJust recently I moved and when I called to transfer the services I asked the CSR if there were going to be any fees associated with the transfer and she assured me there would not be. When the guy came to install it again I asked him \""this gonna cost me anything?\"" again the answer was no. Just got my bill and guess how much.... $266!! $146+ more than it's supposed to be. $120 INSTALLATION FEES. Oh and now my monthly charges went up from $120 to $157/month. Im livid.

2945,0,"I usually come to Le Confessional on a Thursday night because it gets happening on Thursday nights.  The drink prices are not cheap but not exorbitant.  The music is very diverse (from house to hip hop).  The crowd is also a reflection of the music, diverse.  \n\nOn my most recent visit, I was disappointed with the coat check process.  It took a long time to get my coat, plus they handed me 4 wrong umbrellas until the right one was finally handed to me.  However, It was the only blemish on that night.  Overall, Le Confessional is a place you want to start your evening off, not where you stay the whole night.",4
2946,0,Been to the Squash Blossom twice and have been happy with both visits. The food was really good for the price. Waitresses were very nice and polite. Banana Pecan French was awesome left the restaurant in a food coma. The bacon and eggs was really good. The fruit and small red velvet cupcake with the meal was nice. Give this small business a try if you're in the area.,3
2947,0,"This is just a review of their savory foods. The menu offers three types, the savory, the deli, and the pizza crepe. Qualitatively, there is not too much difference because many of the ingredients overlap, replace the pepperoni in the pizza crepe with deli meat and you've got a deli crepe. They are generous with the amount of ingredients in the crepe and you can specify as many types as you wish. Think subway. We had a savory crepe and also tried a waffle sandwich. Both were very filling but soggy and underwhelming. Space is cute and staff is friendly. I will give their sweet crepes a try at some point and try to understand why they have a 5 star yelp rating.",2

Saturdays are reserved for Beatles only music while the rest of the week you can hear anything from Aerosmith to Zepplin playing in the background.\nThis place is a non-ayce place which causes you to be more thoughtful of your choices as to not have to take out a small loan in order to pay your bill since you're used to eating as much as you can stuff down your gullet at other places. Don't misunderstand me, this place is not expensive at all, we're just jaded a bit in this town with sushi prices based on the ayce model. \n\nThis place is refreshing! Small bar and dining that makes the quaintness of the place cozy as opposed to cramped.\nThe Service is Superb! You feel as if you are a guest rather than a customer. \nThe quality is exactly what you'd hope to find at a REAL Sushi Bar. Top quality ingredients with great attention to detail not only with Chef Aki  mastering his craft but from the kitchen staff as well. Chef Aki's rolls are very artistically done with much pride and enthusiasm as you might be able to tell from photos (try the Hello Kitty Roll).\n\nThe bonus to this place is their daily lunch special. Each day of the week has a different Bento Box Special  priced at just $5. McDonald's across the way can't match that price.

It came in a bigger portion than we expected.  I would say sharing that with 3 or 4 people is best.  It starts to taste  a little overwhelming when your eating too many at once.  Remember to eat these while their still hot, they taste oilier as it gets colder.  It was really good. \n\nThe only thing I would complain about was that the cream of spinach was too salty.

I had to yell back at her to get her to come back over, the food wasn't anything special and tasted like I warmed it up in the microwave at home, not to mention it took over 20 minutes to get a sub sandwich and a slice of pizza.

We danced a bit or more like swayed cause it was too crowded.

I explained to the waitress that I wanted the meat done just so it was a little pink in the middle and she said \""so we'll go with medium rare\"" , I went along with it figuring she worked there and she would know best since I explained in detail what I wanted. Result: It came out very rare and almost raw in my opinion (just barely browned on outside and all pink everywhere else), there was barely any blue cheese to taste on it and the bottom half of my bun was soaked in grease just like I would expect from a burger at a bar. \n\nMy summary: might be a good place to get a drink and watch the game, but eat at your own risk.\nP.S.

2973,0,"I found this place for dinner in Edinburgh because I know how much the other half loves wines and wine bars. A friend had suggested quite a few places for dinner, but none of them seemed overly exciting to him, so we came here.\n\nWe came in on a Thursday night around 6:30 and the place was already quite busy. For me, that's a sign of a good place! We were seated at a table, and quite soon afterwards a large party came in, so we all shifted around to give them more seating (which turned out to be a HUGE mistake). \n\nWe started with a bottle of English white wine and a cheese plate. It consisted of three cheese. We chose it over the meat and cheese plate solely because that one contained manchego and gorganzola. Both nice cheeses, but nothing special. One of the people at the other table really wasn't paying any attention to anything around her except chatting while trying to get up, so she knocked a bottle of water over onto our cheese plate. They did end up getting us another cheese plate (which hey, it might have been cheese overload, but oh well), which consisted of four cheeses instead of three. And two of them were different. It's a bit strange that they opted to give us the manchego and gorganzola on the second plate in place of one of the cheeses, but maybe they were out.\n\nWe then ordered some Italian red wine and the spaghetti with salami in a garlic cream sauce and the ham risotto. It took awhile due to the large table next to us, but we weren't in a hurry so we just enjoyed our wine. The mains were good. We also split the sticky toffee pudding at the end with some port, and that was probably the least good thing of the night. It wasn't sticky enough for me!\n\nThe table of twelve next to us kind of ballooned into around 20 by the end. It was a bit too much for such a small restaurant. I kind of wish they told them they couldn't accommodate such a large party, but I don't even think they thought it was going to get as big as it did! \n\nThe owner (I think he was the owner, who knows?) came up to us at the end, and he started talking with us a bit about wine. He said we had good taste and picked some of the better wine on the menu. That's always a pleasant surprise!",2
2975,0,"This was my first buffet I've been since being away from Vegas for years. And this wasn't my best decision. \n\nMy boys and I were wanted to grab a meal at a buffet before our night out in the city of sin.  Apparently, this was the closest one and had a short line. Once we got to cashier, I was in shock to hear how much an individual had to pay for buffet dinner. For the price for an individual had to pay, we could've got the 24 hour buffet pass. More buffets to visit at different hotels.\n\nOnce we paid, we waited a couple minutes for our table.  After our table was ready and then seated, our server took our drink orders. When everything was settled at the table, we were off to explore the buffet's offerings.\n\nThe selections were very limited since some stations were left unreplenished. With what was available, I had to make my $47 dinner worth it. I went for the grilled meats: kobe beef & prime rib, short rib tacos, assortments of sushi & sashimi, and beef Wellington. For dessert, I got mini churros and vending machine ice cream.\n\nThe pros:\n- Short rib tacos\n- Shasimi & sushi\n\nThe cons:\n- Grilled meats were very dry, also the beef Wellington\n- Mini churros were hard and stale\n- Ice cream from the vending machine taste like any other buffet place back home\n\nOur server was helpful but got all our drink orders wrong. I left full, dissaponinted, and unsatisfied.",1

2977,0,"I had some pretty high expectations for this buffet and i was disappointed. For the price 30 per person on a weekday and considering this buffets' location i expect better. The food was just OK. Some of the highlights I had were the already pealed shrimp, prime rib and some of the pasta's. Some of the low lights, the Chinese food, the sushi and the desserts. Chinese food was crap, the sushi was sub par although there was a large selection. The dessert stations looked nice but the food itself wasn't good. And now for the BIGGEST low light. The crab legs. I had some high expectations for them, including love when i saw that they were already cracked open and all you needed was your fork so that you could just remove the meat and eat. The problem....they were frozen solid. I took two legs and let them rest a few mins figuring they would thaw out and be ok...they were too far gone frozen. Honestly just crappy. I was very disappointed with the whole thing especially for the place and the price.",0
2978,0,The teens who work here are quite rude. Wasn't expecting much for the few items I had but the service was terrible. I was the only customer in the store when I walked in and they stayed behind the counter the whole time.,0
2979,0,"I was not impressed!! I went here because of the reviews, but found that the service was poor, the food mediocre, and not hot enough for me.

We tried their buffalo wings the first time, and they weren't very good. That's probably the only thing keeping us from ordering more often, their appetizers are really limited.",2
2983,0,"I was referred to this company by another landscaping company who didn't serve the east valley. Dave responded almost immediately to my email inquiry and was able to come out to my house on my next available day. He gave me an upfront quote (although a little higher than other companies), I decided to go with them because of the ease of communication. He came out as promised and the work got done quickly by him & his team of guys. \n\nI'll definitely use AZ Landscaping Co for my future landscaping/irrigation needs.",4
2984,0,"I was quite skeptical of Republic Ramen at first--not because of how it looked, smelled, or what I had heard but because why would there be a restaurant charging 8 dollars for what I can make for .14 cents?\n\nMan was I wrong. My friends invited me and when I showed up I was happily surprised by the very clean restaurant. Couples sat in the back eating and drinking sake. The lady at the counter was very friendly and when I asked for an explanation of the menu she was very helpful. \n\nThe menu works something like this: pick your broth (they have 5 or 6), then pick the meat. The vegetables are standard but they do have some extras including kimchi!\n\nAnd the kimchi was amazing, the perfect amount of spice. And it tasted great when put into the ramen. \n\nThe goyza and tempura were amazing and after finishing them I only wanted more. I got their standard ramen with chicken and while the chicken was a tad dry (overcooked) the taste of the broth and the freshness of the vegetables more then made up for it.\n\nThough I've only been once I plan on going again, to try some of their other broths.",2

I don't know why I didn't get a second opinion.  Two months later my pet died.  I really liked this office at first, but after the lack of action and knowledge (or even suggesting they didn't know what to do to see someone else) I won't be returning.",0
2986,0,"Average burger, average taste, above average prices. Anyone who thinks this is good food has no credibility when it comes to food. If you want cheap cheese, bland meat, and a lot of grease and want to pay too much this is the place. I go to Columbus OH for work, Graffiti burger is the place over there. They have a big sign over the Five Guys in Columbus. I passed by the Five Guys, almost empty, go to Graffiti, PACKED. There is a reason for that, they serve the best burgers around. I so wish AZ had a place like that. Until that happens, I am in search for the best burger in AZ.",0
2987,0,Hot Shot Vegas definitely took care of our bachelorette party while we were in Vegas. Jason was very easy to reach and always available. Hot Shot Vegas was extremely accommodating to all of our needs. They were also able to help us out getting into clubs based on our budget.\n\nI definitely recommend them for whatever size party you have. Pricing was very reasonable and it beat standing in a taxi line any day of the week! =)\n\nThanks again Jason!! You made our trip so much smoother...

2988,0,"Speakeasy, Craft Cocktails, Intimate Surrounding, and Chic Atmosphere = LUV!\n\nReservation will be hard to make the day of, but it isn't  impossible to check out The Laundry Room if you do some early planning; earlier the better! \n\nThe Laundry Room is tiny, so reservation is limited. The room only holds 3 tables (1-table of 2, 2-tables of 4) and a bar that holds about 6 seats. As any Speakeasy should be, the door is discreet.

I thought my Gin Fizz and Bee's Knee were a 4-star, but the Rattlesnake was a solid 5. The Rattlesnake was recommended by the Mixologist of the night, Daniel. The service was attentive and our hostess, Cara, was super sweet. Thanks for the great drinks and service! \n\nThe drinks are listed based on Liquor making it easy to select.

Literally they dipped-in and removed nearly DOUBLE the amount they should have! To add insult to injury, they made the unilateral, ignorant decision to KEEP/credit my cash rather than immediately return the amount to my checking account.  \n\nIt cost me a tremendous amount of time in repeated phone calls, terrible stress, and skimping on GROCERIES for the week it took them to fix their error!!\nDISGUSTING.\n\nAnd as warning - truly do not ever enroll in AutoPay!!  \n\nThe Banks consider it \""At your own risk\"" - and Cox apparently knows this:  they haphazardly commit egregious errors in which they grossly OVERPAY themselves \""by mistake.\""   Additionally, the billing cycles starts 60 minutes after the last one,  which  means you're ALWAYS in a billing-cycle and can NEVER REMOVE Auto-Pay!

2992,0,"Although my previous experiences were 5 star experiences, lately, the Breakfast Joynt has been disappointing. Very disappointing...\n\nToday's breakfast broke the camel's back, so to speak: for the second time I had to send my eggs back due to improper cooking, and pretty much everything on my plate was below average.\nIn addition, although very nice, the wait staff was largely hanging out in back, and not in the front of the house checking on the few customers that were dining. \n\nI know this establishment is capable of doing better. I've tasted it. Whether there is someone new in the kitchen, or they're simply not paying attention, it shows a slip in their food, and let's face it, if it's not right and tasty, there are dozens of other places to go for breakfast. \n\nMy ham today tasted as though it had fallen into the syrup today and it wasn't that yummy brown sugar type of sweet that you would expect on ham. \nIn addition, our hash browns were largely uncooked, but flash burned on the grill. \nEnglish muffins that weren't toasted nearly enough, and eggs cooked incorrectly.\n\nI'm disappointed in the Breakfast Joynt. Hopefully, they'll clean up their act. Until then, I'm returning to Chompies for breakfast, where I know that I'll get great food consistently...",0
2993,0,I had a great cupping and deep tissue massage with Elliot. He was very professional and listened to what I wanted him to work on. The atmosphere was very soothing and it smelled fantastic. The price is cheap considering the care and great service. I'm planning on being a regular customer!,3
2994,0,"This only gets a 3 because the cheese's and meats are really quite good, but everything is really average and the service is nothing special.  Try the cheese selection, go for seven as you can order 3, 5 or 7 and you end up ordering 7 in the end and if you order 3 and then another 3 it's more expensive than ordering 7.  We ate here twice on our 5 day stay, the first time we went we had the 7 cheese's ( if they have the robiola, get a few of them, it's so good, kind of like a sweeter, softer, milder saint andre)  the arancini, and 2 pasta's.  Again the cheese were good, but it's not like they're making it so whatever.  You'll get 3 accompanyments with your cheese and bread; black truffle honey, apricot mustardo and brandy preserved cherries.  You only get 3-5 cherries and you'll need more so order them right away, beware they only sell them by the 10's and it's $5 for 10 small (very small cherries)  Losen up on the purse string Batalli!  We ended up loving the cherries so much that we bought a jar for $35, they're jars are not seeled they'll put them in a mason jar for you to take home.\nThe arancini were terrible, although my husband didn't mind them.  The pasta was gross... I can't remember what is was and we also had the veal meatball with a polenta sauce, again not so good.  It was moist and tender but seriously lacked flavor.  We also had the \""pick me up\"" which is sort of a deconstructed tiramisu with expresso gelato, it was good, not great.  The second time we went we went straight to meats and cheese, paid too much for cherries again (server was a little annoying), had the tiramisu thing again and that was that.   3 because the entree's were really bad.",2

I've had several dentists in the past and Dr. Yu is the best by far.  Dentistry really is an art... you can settle for some 'other guy' because he's close to your office or really cheap but you're only doing yourself a disservice.  Stop wasting time reading reviews and just book your appointment with Dr. Yu; you'll be glad you did.,4
