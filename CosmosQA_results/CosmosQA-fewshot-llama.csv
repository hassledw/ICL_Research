Context: Let me preface this announcement by saying that I am a pretty big fan of classic movies . I believe that what Hollywood of today makes up for in special effects , graphics , realism , and sound ; they lost in the engaging dialogue and interesting characters that were abundant in the 30 's , 40 's and 50 's and somewhat into the 60 's .

Context: I ' m not trying to disparage our team right now , believe me . They put on a hell of a show last night , and John Parker Wilson is owed a big apology by just about every Alabama fan out there , ourselves included . The way he handled the Georgia defense was nothing short of spectacular and his downfield passing reached an entirely new level last night thanks to some tremendous blocking up front and great catches by his receivers . But the same consistency issues that have plagued the Crimson Tide for so many years now are still here , be it the sleep walk against Tulane or the second half loss of focus by the defense , and I can only hope that the team continues to improve each and every week like it has so far this season .

1.None of the above choices .
2.Because they allowed rumors to circulate about his marriage that were n't true
