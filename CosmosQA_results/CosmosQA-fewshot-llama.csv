Context: The backdrop is of post - war Germany and all of its peoples ' homecoming tales , and later , the nation 's divided self reuniting . The book touches on evil , justice , ethics and morals and the place of each in both the psyche and the modern world .

So , last night , I started reading Farenheit 451-which may come as a surprise since I ' m generally not known for my fondness of sci - fi . It 's really "" hard sci - fi "" that I do n't care for , and it 's not for any other reason than it simply is not my cuppa . It 's nothing against the genre itself .
