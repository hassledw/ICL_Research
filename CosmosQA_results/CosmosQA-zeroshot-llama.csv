Even though I am an employee I still retain scheduling flexibility because they have no office and all client visits I schedule and are in client 's home or at a DHS branch . In fact one of the job qualifications was to be a good self manager because you wo n't have someone looking over your shoulder ... that fits me ! I invested in a itouch ( business write off a perk of self - employment ) so I can sync my calendar from Outlook and listen to music of course .
Question: What may be the reason the writer applied for this job ?
Options:
0.the writer hated their old job
1.the job has a flexible schedule
2.the writer likes being in the DHS branch
3.the writer wants to listen to music
