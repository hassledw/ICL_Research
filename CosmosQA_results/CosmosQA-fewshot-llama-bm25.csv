Context: It 's well worth the effort however , as ' Pan Tadeusz ' is a richly rewarding read . The translation I read was by Kenneth R. Mackenie , which was the first to maintain the metre and rhyming couplets of the original throughout its 10,000 lines . Obviously there must have been some compromises made to achieve that , and there is the occasional rhyme that grated , but overall the poem reads as if it was written in English . Without wanting to give the ending away , it is the various characters love of their country and determination to liberate themselves from Russian rule that overrides all other thoughts .

We had over 170 friendly faces in the audience at our closing show , 8 seats from selling out ( broke our previous record of 168 butts in seats at our second show of the run ) , and the audience was into it and really vocal and we really appreciated their energy -- PLUS neither Laura nor I lost control of our motor functions , which is always a danger . PLUS , we got tapped for the Gremlin Theatre remount at their new space ( formerly the Loading Dock Theater ) .

Context: September 11th appears to have been quite an angry day for me ... Well , to post such a vitriolic message to the Boy simply to vent is a bit childish . That said , I sha n't delete the post . That would sort of defeat the point of it all . When going through old journals that I used to keep , I often find scrawled pages that I had originally written in a fit of peak and then decided that they were far to incendiary to keep and thus scribbled through them . But that 's not how journals are meant to work .
Question: Why does the writer believe journals are not supposed to work that way ?
Options:
0.Because the writer wo n't delete a post .
1.Because whatever is written in them is supposed to stay as it is .
2.None of the above choices .
3.Because September 11th was an angry day for the writer .
